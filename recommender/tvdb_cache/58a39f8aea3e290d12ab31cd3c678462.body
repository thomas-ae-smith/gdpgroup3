<Overview>Property expert Sunita Shroff whisks house hunters to areas they would never normally consider looking for a home. They are taken to viewings in a blacked-out car, leaving them entirely in the dark as to the location of the properties, and ensuring they judge each house on its merits rather than its postcode.

Only if they fall for a house will they find out where it is, and then decide whether that area really can work for them.</Overview>
