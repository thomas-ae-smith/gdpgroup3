<Overview>The story takes place after The Ghost Busters (starring Forrest Tucker, Larry Storch, and Bob Burns). But this time their sons are joined up with Tracey the gorilla (who returns), Jessica ( a TV reporter), Futura (a mysterious woman from the future), and Belfry the bat. At their HQ "Ghost Command" they battle the evil spooks of Prime Evil, at his "Haunt-Quarters" and even through space and time in their transforming GhostBuggy. For those of you who don't the story of how  The Real Ghostbusters got the name, here's the lowdown (thanks to ProtonCharging.com): When the movie was being made it turned out that Filmation Associates already had a show called "Ghostbusters". Due to the popularity of the Ivan Reitman directed movie, Filmation revamped their show and made it animated, "Filmations' GhostBusters" (a.k.a. "the Original GhostBusters").

<Overview>Welcome to the Slimer! And the Real Ghostbusters guide at TV Tome.
The season had it's name changed during the 3rd season to The Real Ghostbusters. 
This wasn't so much a spinoff, as a continuation of the Real Ghostbusters cartoon.  It was an attempt to retarget the show at a younger audience, by having shorter Ghostbusters episodes, followed by short "Slimer" episodes where Slimer had to deal with some problem as well as a few secondary characters that didn't appear on the regular show. In general, this show was considered to be the beginning of the end for the series.  It failed to boost the show's popularity as it both alienated older fans and failed to attract younger ones, and it's also generally agreed that quality of animation suffered considerably when this season started. If you like this show check out The Real Ghostbusters.</Overview>

<Overview>"Who ya gonna call?" There's been a lull in ghost activity in New York City and the Ghostbusters have long been out of business. Only Egon Spengler and ghostly sidekick Slimer remain. Egon has begun teaching a college paranormal course when ghosts emerge from the New York underground. The torch is thus passed to a new team of Ghostbusters: Roland, Garrett, Eduardo and Kylie. Guided by Egon and with advanced equipment, the Extreme Ghostbusters face off against nastier and meaner ghosts. This show is very loosely based on the previous shows and movies. The only real concept thats stays the same is Slimer, Egon, and the Ghostbusting.</Overview>
