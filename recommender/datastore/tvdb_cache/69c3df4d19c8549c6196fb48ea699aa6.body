  <Overview>The premier episode of Season 2 begins with an introduction to our six farmer bachelors: Ben, Howie, James, Michael, Nick and Rob. Selected from farmers-applicants all over the country, these six are all ready to meet the girl of their dreams and settle down. In the first episode, each farmer chooses 10 women from his own shortlist to participate in a speed dating session. The farmers get to spend 5 minutes with each of the city girls, in which time he needs to decide whom he has a connection with. Only five of the girls can be selected to move on the next stage of proceedings: the group date.</Overview>

At the end of the group date, each farmer is expected to choose two girls with whom he has a connection, to invite back to his farm, where they will spend 10 days establishing the foundations for a potential relationship.

However, Farmer Michael received an employment offer of some shearing work and, due to money concerns, reluctantly left the show to pursue the work opportunity.</Overview>

  <Overview>The third episode sees each farmer playing host to his two chosen women, when they come to visit at the farm. In the previous episode, each farmer narrowed their list of girls down to two, and these two women were then invited for a 10-day stay on their chosen farmer's property.

Immediate attraction occurs for farmer Rob, but it is drama for Nick when one of his girls does not show up. Farmer James fails to impress his chosen ladies, Ben seems torn between both women and Howie has his own issues when one of his ladies has a problem with farm life.

In a surprising twist, Michael decides to return to the show after the job opportunity of the previous episode fell through. His return sees a late invitation to his chosen women.</Overview>

  <Overview>Episode four sees life on the farm continuing as the farmers take time out from their regular chores to get to know each of the two women they invited back to their properties.

One of the highlights of this part of the stay is the farmers' chance to introduce their chosen ladies to their family and/or friends. Nick takes his girls home to meet his mum and sister, who take a shine to outgoing Stephanie.

Howie takes his girls to meet his friends but confesses privately that he has not felt a connection with either lady. James causes drama, and a heated confrontation with Toni, when he neglects both his ladies in order to party with his mates, Returned farmer Michael takes his ladies to the local pub, where he spends some one-on-one time with both girls.

This week also sees only couple Rob and Jo's relationship hotting up as their feelings towards each other grow.</Overview>

  <Overview>This episode follows our farmers on their last days spent with their visiting ladies. For most of the farmers this is their last chance to spend some quality time with each woman before they head back to the city.

Farmer Rob and Jo, who have already fallen for each other, take the opportunity this episode to confess to Rob's other choice, Emmaline, that they are now together. Nick and Steph seem to be getting things together after a romantic couple of days without Kristy.

Howie confesses to both his girls that he hasn't developed feelings for either of them, leaving Karen broken-hearted. James is still creating drama with his two women, whereas Michael's attention now seems firmly focussed on Jenni.

In a big twist, Farmer Ben confesses his feelings to Emma, only for Emma to turn around and declare that she doesn't feel strongly enough to pursue a relationship.</Overview>

  <Overview>The series final follows the six farmers as they travel to the city to knock on the door of the girl they have chosen, to see if she also wants to pursue a relationship.

Rob travelled to Jo's door, and she soon introduced him to her parents. Ben knocked on Sarah's door and Michael visited Simone's house looking to pursue a relationship. James chose Toni as his potential lady, and Nick visited Kristy.

As a bonus, this episode also presents a follow-up on our farmers to see where their love-lives are at now. Wedding bells seem to be ringing for love-struck couple Rob and Jo. Nick, in a shock decision, reveals that he has found love with Kristy. Ben and Sarah are also enjoying their developing relationship.

Sadly, for the other three farmers, Howie, James and Michael, none of their chosen women turned out to be 'the one', and are all out searching for love again.</Overview>
