<SeriesName>1914-1918 The Great War</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/83978-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The World War of 1914-18 - The Great War, as contemporaries called it -- was the first man-made catastrophe of the 20th century. Historians can easily identify the literal "smoking gun" that set the War in motion: a revolver used by a Serbian nationalist to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand (heir apparent to the Austro-Hungarian throne) in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914.
 But scholars are still debating the underlying causes. Was it the desire for greater empire, wealth and territory? A massive arms race? The series of treaties which ensured that once one power went to war, all of Europe would quickly follow? Was it social turmoil and changing artistic sensibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution? Or was it simply a miscalculation by rulers and generals in power? The answer provided in "The Great War and The Shaping of the 20th Century" is that all of these volatile elements combined to set off a gigantic explosion we now know as World War I.

<SeriesName>War of the Century</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/81267-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>One of the most emotionally powerful of all World War II documentaries.
It begins with the story of Operation Barbarossa, and Germany's subsequent war against the Soviet Union. Altering the course of World War II, it shaped the borders and attitudes of Europe for the second half of the 20th Century.
It was a catastrophic mistake. Napoleon had tried it and failed. Yet in 1941, Hitler broke the golden rule of warfare, never to fight on opposite fronts, and marched into the Soviet Union. The annihilation of the Soviets would have meant the death of Communism and the Slavs. It would have meant living space for the voracious Third Reich. But Hitler overlooked two things: the withering Soviet winters and the brutality of Stalin's rearguard action. It was the largest and bloodiest military operation in history and by the end of the campaign 30 million had died.
With commentary from leading historians, unique access to newly available documentary and film archives and both Soviet and German eye-witness testimony, this could be the definitive series on a key turning point in history.

<SeriesName>In Search of the Trojan War</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/79613-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>In Search of the Trojan War followed the successful formula established by his first historical detective series, In Search of the Dark Ages, and firmly established Michael Wood as the most personable of TV historians. Wood is not only a born TV presenter, he's got both the academic gravitas and the narrative skill to craft a compelling mystery from the archaeological, literary and mythological sources. Over six hour-long programs, Wood marshals the disparate strands of evidence to present as fully rounded a portrait as possible of both the historical and the legendary city of Troy, its central place in Western culture, and the Mycenaean Age itself. From Schliemann's initial cavalier bulldozing of the mound at Hisarlik, to Homer's epics, the Hittite Empire, and the role of slave women, Wood journeys back and forth across the Aegean and elsewhere, from a pre-unification Berlin to Liverpool, to illuminate the dawn of Western literature, myth, and history. Did the Trojan war ever happen, or was the city destroyed by natural causes? Wood doesn't claim to find a definitive answer, of course, but for the viewer it's rewarding enough simply to accompany him on this fascinating journey.</Overview>

<banner>graphical/81065-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The War of the World is a major new history of the 20th Century by the acclaimed and controversial historian Professor Niall Ferguson, described by The Times as the 'most brilliant British historian of his generation'.

We think we know the last century well, but our view of it was skewed by the fact that we were living through it. Now, six years into a new century, Professor Ferguson argues that we need to re-think our understandings fundamentally. He shows that in the last century there were not in fact two World Wars and a Cold War, but a single Hundred Years' War. It was not nationalism that powered the conflicts of the century, but empires. It was not ideologies of class or the advent of socialism that was the driving force of the century, but race. It was ultimately ethnic conflict that underpinned 20th-century violence. And finally, it was not the West that triumphed as the century progressed; in fact power slowly and steadily migrated towards the new empires of the East.

Setting arguments and narratives in striking global locations including China, Japan, Russia, the United States, Germany, Iran, Poland and the United Kingdom, Professor Ferguson explains why the last century was the most bloody in world history.</Overview>

Was Czechoslovakia abandoned by Britain and France, sacrificed in the face of Hitler's aggression? In The Road to War, acclaimed historians Richard Overy and Andrew Wheatcroft cogently piece together a globe fractured by war to show how conditions such as the lack of sophisticated intelligence-gathering techniques, limited communication, and events in the USSR and the Far East all conspired to forge a world of shifting alliances, and difficult decisions. </Overview>

<Overview>In the late 1930s, world politics begin to head in a dangerous direction. In Europe, Germany expands and rearms and proceeds to annex several border countries into the Reich. Meanwhile, Italy attempts to establish a Facist Colonial Empire under Mussolini while the Empire of Japan stands ready for a major war with China. Enter the Henry family, headed by career naval officer Victor "Pug" Henry. "Winds of War" thus follows the exploits of Pug and his children, all of which are set against the backdrop of world events leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. </Overview>

<SeriesName>The War That Made America</SeriesName>
<banner>blank/121021-2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>"The War That Made America" brings to life a vastly important—but often misunderstood—period of American history, a period that set in motion forces that would culminate in the American Revolution. The dramatic documentary tells the story of the French and Indian War (1754-1763), which began in the wilderness of the Pennsylvania frontier and spread throughout the colonies, into Canada, and ultimately around the world.

Narrated and hosted by Graham Greene, the Academy-Award nominated actor for "Dances With Wolves" and an Oneida Indian whose ancestors fought in this war, "The War That Made America" combines a commitment to accuracy with a compelling filmed portrayal of the dangerous world of the 18th-century frontier. 

A central figure is George Washington, then a brash and ambitious young officer in his twenties hoping to make his reputation in the military, whose blunders actually trigger the war. A primary focus of the series, and a story that has long been distorted or forgotten, is the critical military importance and strategic diplomacy of Native Americans in the conflict between the English and French for the expansion of their colonial empires.  It was a war the British won, but the fruit of their victory contained the seeds of the Revolutionary War.</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Civil War</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/78973-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Between 1861 and 1865, Americans made war on each other and killed each other in great numbers - if only to become the kind of country that could no longer conceive of how that was possible. What began as a bitter dispute over Union and States' Rights, ended as a struggle over the meaning of freedom in America. At Gettysburg in 1863, Abraham Lincoln said perhaps more than he knew. The war was about a "new birth of freedom." The most successful public-television miniseries in American history, the 11-hour Civil War didn't just captivate a nation, reteaching to us our history in narrative terms; it actually also invented a new film language taken from its creator. When people describe documentaries using the "Ken Burns approach," its style is understood: voice-over narrators reading letters and documents dramatically and stating the writer's name at their conclusion, fresh live footage of places juxtaposed with still images (photographs, paintings, maps, prints), anecdotal interviews</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Vietnam War</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/97851-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>At a total cost of more than 3.1 million lives, the Vietnam conflict is, to date, America s longest and most controversial war. It also marked the first time TV journalists ventured out to the frontlines to bring the spectacle of combat into American living rooms. Across the nation, Americans watched, captivated by the surprise Tet Offensive and the slow-motion tragedy of the 77-day Battle of Khe Sanh, and witnessed the courage and skill of American soldiers at decisive engagements like Ia Drang Valley, Con Thien, and Dak To.

Now THE HISTORY CHANNEL presents a comprehensive 2-disc set that profiles the decision-makers and chronicles each key event in the Vietnam war, from the advisors arrival in 1959 to the airlift from the roof of the American Embassy in 1975. Archival footage and interviews with historians and veterans reveal the military and political strategies in play, and CBS News archives take viewers to the frontlines to witness the daily struggles of American servicemen and women.</Overview>

<SeriesName>The World At War</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/79309-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Originally broadcast in 1973 as 26 one-hour programmes, The World at War sets out to tell the story of the Second World War through the testimony of key participants. The result is a unique and unrepeatable event, since many of the eyewitnesses captured on film did not have long left to live. Each hour-long programme is carefully structured to focus on a key theme or campaign, from the rise of Nazi Germany to Hitler's downfall and the onset of the Cold War. There are no academic "talking heads" here to spell out an official version of history; the narration, delivered with wonderful gravitas by Sir Laurence Olivier, is kept to a minimum. The show's great coup was to allow the participants to speak for themselves. Painstaking research in the archives of the Imperial War Museum also unearthed a vast quantity of newsreel footage, including on occasion the cameraman's original raw rushes which present an unvarnished and never-before-seen picture of important events. Carl Davis' impressive score underlines the grand scale of the enterprise.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Israel and the Arabs: The 50 Years War</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/259085-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The conflict in the Middle East between Israel and its neighbors is given comprehensive treatment in this two-video set produced by PBS. Using archival footage and extensive interviews with participants, the production begins by explaining conditions in Palestine at the end of World War II and the crisis created by the exodus of European Jews who went to the Middle East after the Holocaust. The withdrawal of the British, who had controlled Palestine for decades, is detailed, as is the creation of the state of Israel. Much of the region's history is complex, with the local struggles being conducted at times as a part of the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union, but these videos do an admirable job of explaining the complexities of the situation. The segment on the Six Day War, for example, is masterful, with the scenes shifting from Israel to Egypt to Washington to Moscow, the story developing before the viewer's eyes. The 50 Years War is often a tale of mistrust and betrayal, but this production strives to present a balanced view of history, and is not only impressive for its command of the facts but for its skillful and often dramatic presentation of history. --Robert J.

At its simplest, World War II was a black-and-white struggle between good and evil. But the reality was much more complex and best captured in color. A striking assemblage of color footage and photographs from national archives and private collections, the COLOR OF WAR opens fresh perspectives on the day-to-day from every possible front. From the first draftees thrown into the breach to the sheer boredom between battles to the uniforms worn and the objects carried, this unparalleled saga is further illuminated by letters and diaries, communiqués from the battlefield, and the sounds and songs of the era.

Narrated by Peter Coyote (Erin Brockovich, E.T.), the 17 programs included in the COLOR OF WAR present the most extensive all-color documentary ever produced on the Second World War.</Overview>

It was to be the definitive history of the First World War, complete in twenty-six 40-minute episodes. An inspired account of the world-shattering events of 1914-1918, The Great War is narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave and employs the voice skills of many other leading actors of the day including Sir Ralph Richardson and Marius Goring. The series includes authentic archive footage and stunning photographic images gathered from 37 separate sources around the world. It also features interviews with many veterans of the war (by this time most were still only in their 60s), as well as almost 150 separate extracts from diaries, letters and reports from the war.</Overview>
