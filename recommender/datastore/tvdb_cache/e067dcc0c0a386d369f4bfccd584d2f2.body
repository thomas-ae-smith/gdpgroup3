<Overview>Polish version of Ally McBeal starring Joanna Brodzik as Magda Milowicz a 30 something Warsaw Lawyer who spends more time fretting over her on again off again romance with Piotr (Pawel Malaszynski) than actually lawyering. Throw in a bunch of friends who bounce from one failed relationship to another and away you go. Actually if ou crossed "Friends" with "Ally McBeal" took out the humour and changed it to Polish you would get this show. A bit whiney in my opinion but the wife absolutely loves it to bits. Although to be fair i don't understand Polish so i miss half the nuances of what is probably fine entertainment. 
Currently in it's 4th or 5th season</Overview>

<Overview>Another story of a big family whose life is full of problems and unexpected changes. Barbara and Lucjan are about 60-years-old. They have three daughters and one son. But the truth is that the oldest one, already married and having two sons (who are twins) is not Lucjan's daughter. When a bad sister-in-law tells her it it's like a storm over the family. And it's only an example taken from a complicated life of the Mostowiaks family. With each new episode (there are close to 500 of them by now) there are more things happening. The Mostowiaks' children know how to make their lives not boring for those who watch.</Overview>

<Overview>The daily routine of a weird, but at the same time, normal Greek couple!

Dimitra (Dimitra Papadopoulou - also screenwriter of the series), a Greek woman of average IQ in her 30s, and Thodoris (Thodoris Atheridis), a normal Greek lad, star in this sweet comedy which shows how strange and funny can sometimes a relationship be. Every episode is just a few scenes of what a couple would do on a daily basis, such as shopping, watching TV, going for coffee, visiting friends, driving in car, going to the movies etc... The weird thing about it, is that the camera is ALWAYS put in a way, so as ONLY the main two actors (Dimitra &amp; Thodoris) are shown. The other actors (friends, relatives, strangers) DO play a role, and DO speak, but we just don't see their faces, we only see their hands or their feet! It is indeed strange, but it wants to emphasize on the COUPLE and their feelings and reactions. Every word exchanged between Dimitra and Thodoris, every sentence, is so funny and sincere at the same time, and the whole image of them would be the most realistic picture of a Greek couple. The most important thing, is that you NEVER get bored. The screen is build upon very short dialogues, conversations, which are very typical of a Greek couple, but of course, there is some repetition of specific phrases, so that the couple has some "character". For instance, Dimitra wonders from the very first episode "When will I become a mother?", and is always whining to Thodoris, trying to convince him to have a baby! All in all, S'agapo M'agapas will always be in my heart, because even though it's about 5 years old, I still can't help laughing when I'm watching it! </Overview>
