    <Overview>They were three hipper-than-hip undercover cops with a touch of menace and plenty of attitude. They walked the walk and talked the talk--and an entire generation stepped into line. Julie, Linc and Pete--Peggy Lipton, Clarence Williams III and Michael Cole, respectively--changed the television landscape. Now, take a journey back to the turbulent '60s and relive the phenomenon known as The Mod Squad, a bold TV series that redefined fashion, from hairstyles to language.   &quot;Solid.&quot; One Black, One White, One Blonde.................. The early cop show format, as defined by shows like Dragnet, was certainly entertaining, but let's face itÂ¦sometimes those flatfoots could be a bit square. The cops doled out justice, but they didn't have a lot of fun doing it. It seemed that the description of TV cops might never include the word &quot;cool,&quot; until (whew!) The Mod Squad showed up to save the day. </Overview>
