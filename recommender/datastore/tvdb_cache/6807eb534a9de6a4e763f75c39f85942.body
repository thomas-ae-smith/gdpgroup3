  <Overview>In the series premiere of For Love or Money we were first introduced to 15 beautiful women during their obligatory limo ride up the panoramic California coastline. The bachelorettes range from virginal ingÃ©nues to savvy society girls: one has been engaged five times while another has taken a vow of celibacy. My favorite though, was the 34-year-old who declared she was infinitely wiser than her 20-something counterparts. We'll see.
The girls squealed with delight as they rolled up to an expansive mansion and were greeted by a non-descript host (Jordan Murphy). He might as well have shot off a starter gun as the girls dashed frantically to claim rooms and buddy up. Glamour girl Kelly and sassy Cristy C, emerged as the biggest threats as they clamored to claim the best room. They were also stripped to their bikinis and lounging poolside before the other girls had even caught their breath. The anti-Kelly and Cristy were wholesome Paige and down-to-earth Erin who also teamed up as roommates</Overview>

  <Overview>With the first round of eliminations over, the ten remaining ladies became competitors instead of roomies. Jordan interrupted breakfast with the latest development. The good news: the dating starts! The bad news: only eight women would participate. Huh? As jaws were dropping onto fancy breakfast plates, Jordan explained. The ladies would vote on which two girls would sit home at the mansion building up anger and resentment while the other eight enjoyed fantasy dates with Rob. Wonder if Kelly was rethinking her snotty attitude at this point?
If that wasn't bad enough, Jordan made them REVEAL who they each voted for!! Talk about awkward. Everyone seemed to have lost their appetites as they revealed their votes. Stacey voted for Paige. Christina voted for Erin. Alima voted for Kelly. Melissa voted for Kelly. Laura voted for Paige. Erin and Kelly both picked Melissa. Melanie, Lauren and Paige chose Kelly. Some girls chose to explain their votes; others just silently revealed their choice.</Overview>

  <Overview>Only five ladies remained: Erin, Kelly, Laura, Lauren and Paige. Whether they were in it for love or money, they each had to convince Rob that they were the one for him. Laura got the chance when she awoke first to discover an invitation at the top of the stairs. It offered the first early riser the opportunity to serve Rob breakfast in bed. After showering and borrowing Lauren's dress, Laura started getting nervous about what to make. Lauren, in true Paige style, offered to help! Ladiesâ€¦what is with the teamwork?! Rob was just rubbing sleep bunnies from his eyes when Laura (accompanied by Lauren) knocked on his door to present breakfast. Lauren quickly went back to the main house while Laura snuggled up to Rob. She claimed money wasn't a factor at this point, and that the game was more about being herself and getting to know Rob. You may remember Laura as the girl from the first episode who claimed that at 34 she knew way more than the other girls. Speaking of the others, the sleeping</Overview>

  <Overview>Welcome to the &quot;&quot;final four&quot;&quot;: Erin, Kelly, Lauren and Paige. The episode started with a little girl talk in the kitchen. Paige asked the others if they were 100% sure they were getting asked back during the last elimination round. Kelly summed things up by saying that they were all 100% sure Laura would be asked back, so now, anything is possible. Jordan arrived and explained what would happen over the next two days. Each girl would have the opportunity for a one-on-one date. The dates ranged from the marvelous to the mundane, with one mystery date as well. The four girls had to decide who would go on what date. Paige said she wanted either bowling or the mystery date. Bowling?! The girls decided to randomly draw dates. Erin drew the &quot;&quot;mystery date.&quot;&quot; Paige got a romantic gondola ride, Kelly got bowling and Lauren wound up with horseback riding. Kelly and Lauren were the least thrilled. Lauren had heard that Rob wasn't into horses and Kelly just thought bowling wasn't very romantic. Kelly</Overview>

  <Overview>Erin, Kelly and Paige had the big old mansion to themselves and anxiously awaited their next dates with Rob. What they didn't know was that Rob now knew their million-dollar secret. Rob was also in for another surprise. Jordan told Rob that if he could convince the winning woman to choose him over the cash, Rob would be rewarded with a million dollars himself. Rob was skeptical, but liked the chance to get both the love and the money. However, if the girl chose the cash, Rob would leave with neither love nor money. Confused? That's okay, things are about to get cleared up.
Rob told Jordan that if he was money-oriented he never would've become a public defender. Bottom line, Rob wants to wind up with the girl he thinks is right for him. But on the other hand, maybe he should try for the girl that likes him the best in order to secure the cash. Jordan left Rob to ponder his strategy. It seemed illogical to Rob that a girl who'd only gone out with him four times would pick him over a mill</Overview>

  <Overview>Finale
Now that Rob knew the ladies had a million-dollar check influencing their &quot;&quot;heartfelt&quot;&quot; decisions, he had a new perspective on the game of love. He also had the added incentive that if he got the lady he chose to choose him over the million bucks, Rob would win a million dollars. Paige and Erin soon learned that if Rob picked them, they wouldn't automatically receive their million. Up until this point in the game, they had no idea they'd have to choose between Rob or the money. They thought they'd have their hunk and riches too. Paige just kept saying &quot;&quot;oh my gosh&quot;&quot; over and over. Erin just smiled and said, &quot;&quot;interesting.&quot;&quot; Jordan (he's the host in case you forgot), kept reminding them that it was one or the other. If they chose the money, they'd never see Rob again. If they chose Rob, they could kiss their money goodbye. Once Jordan left, Erin and Paige tried to weasel out of each other what they would pick. Erin thought Paige would always pick Rob, while Paige seemed convinced that</Overview>

  <Overview>With the tables turned and the stakes raised, 15 hot eligible bachelors arrived at the mansion - thinking they were competing for love. Meet the bachelors, click here. They rolled up to the mansion in several Hummers and were immediately impressed with the decadent digs. Jordan greeted them and welcomed them into the house to get to know each other. They shot pool and acted cool around each other, but to camera they talked about how they &quot;&quot;ached for love&quot;&quot; (Chris) and how they had &quot;&quot;their game faces on&quot;&quot; (Deric). Lots of the guys compared their search for love to a game that needed to be won. Strategy was key, as was knowing their opponents. Sounds romantic, eh?
After dinner, Jordan met the guys in the living room and dropped the million-dollar bombshell. The guys just couldn't stop smiling! Jordan proceeded to pass out the checks so that the guys could see what a million dollars made out in their name would look like. Chad V. said that despite the cash prize, he was still hoping to find l</Overview>

  <Overview>Another wonderful day at the mansion began with a hearty breakfast and a heart-to-heart from Jordan. In the main room, Jordan explained that the dating would begin. Only eight of the 10 would be going on group dates in two groups of four. Two guys would be left out. Erin had chosen two guys as &quot;&quot;team captains&quot;&quot; and those two guys would have decide which two would be left out. Wade and Munch were chosen as team captains. The guys seemed to embrace the sports analogy as a dating techniqueâ€¦and why wouldn't they? Wade said there were pros and cons to being a captain. On the plus side, he explained, you were guaranteed to go on the group date. On the negative side, you were definitely going to have whoever you &quot;&quot;cut&quot;&quot; from the dates against you. Wade and Munch went about the business of picking teams. Wade chose Thomas, because he was the youngest and therefore furthest from Erin in age. Munch picked Dan. Greg was next for Wade's team, even though Wade considers him one of the top three guys in</Overview>

  <Overview>The seven remaining guys scampered down to breakfast as the reality of the game set in. One of them would be a millionaire. Jordan arrived and asked the guys to take a gamble. The guys arrived in the game room to find a blackjack table. Six of the guys, Jordan explained, would be going on two separate triple dates. One lucky ace would get his own single date with Erin. A mini-blackjack tournament would decide the winner of the solo date. Jordan dealt the first hand - which eliminated everyone except for Vic and Wade. In the second round, Vic held with 13 while Wade hit on 9 for a 19. Jordan had 9 and hit for 11, then again for 14 and a final time for 18. Luck was a lady that night and Wade had won a single date with Erin.
Then Jordan told Greg, Chad V. and Vic that their date started in one hour! Greg felt his group was a competitive bunch. Vic, who was left out of the prior group date, felt lucky just to be included. High atop a mountain, the guys met Erin at a ropes course. Why she w</Overview>

  <Overview>And then there were five. Wade, Vic, Chad V., Greg and Eric met Jordan poolside to hear the latest on their quest for love - and hopefully a million bucks to boot. To their surprise, a large contraption had been erected over the pool. Jordan explained that four of the five guys would get to go on two separate double dates with Erin. The one remaining bachelor would be left out. In order to determine who would go and who would stay, the guys had to complete a physical challenge. The guys had to hang from a bar suspended above the pool. The man who held on the longest got to choose who would be excluded from the double dates. I liked this competition, if only because it involved all the guys in their swim trunks. To make matters worse, Jordan invited Erin along to watch the guys suffer. They each employed various &quot;&quot;grips&quot;&quot; - over, under, alternating. Greg and Vic slipped into the pool first. Eric fell next after trying to reestablish his grip. Wade and Chad remained. Despite his determinat</Overview>

  <Overview>Jordan woke the sleeping beauties to inform them that the day would hold four dates - but that not all four of them would necessarily be going on them. That Jordan with his cryptic messages! He gave each of the guys a cell phone and explained that Erin also had a phone - programmed with each guy's number. In half an hour, she'd call one of them to go on the first date. At the end of that date (approximately 2 hours), she could call one of the other guys for the second date - or extend the date she was already on. So, theoretically, she could just spend the day with one guy, or spend it with all four guys depending on how things were going.
As the guys got ready, they pondered what quality time with Erin would do for their standings at this point. Eric kept second-guessing his comments at the last elimination ceremony. He thought it was in poor taste to refer to the guy who chose the money (Vic) as &quot;&quot;selling out.&quot;&quot; He really wanted to apologize to Erin for what he perceived as an inapprop</Overview>

  <Overview>Rob's surprise arrival brought mixed feelings to the mansion. Both Rob and Erin had to keep their past a secret; otherwise, the guys would know that Erin had been through this experience before. Meanwhile, Eric seemed a little put off by the fact that the rest of them had endured eliminations and &quot;&quot;put in their time&quot;&quot; while Rob just got to waltz in at the end. Little did he know that Rob had more than paid his dues. Chad wondered if maybe Rob was a one-night stand or an ex-boyfriend, but said he didn't really want to know. Later, he said he couldn't stand him! On the other hand, Wade took it as a sign that things had taken a turn for the worse. When Eric tried to find out how Rob knew Erin, Rob dodged it by saying he didn't want to talk about it. Eric called it a &quot;&quot;lawyer mentality&quot;&quot; that Rob was discussing things on a &quot;&quot;need to know&quot;&quot; basis. Wade was especially peeved that an &quot;&quot;ex-boyfriend&quot;&quot; had been thrown into the mix. Boys, boys, simmer down! Rob felt his advantage was that he knows about</Overview>

  <Overview>It's down to the final three and you know what that means! (Okay, well if you're not a complete reality junkie, it means 24-Hour Fantasy Dates!) Erin tried to put aside the game and follow her heart while she spent time away with each guy. Chad's date was first and he and Erin jetted off to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. They stayed at the Mexican equivalent of the Bel-Air mansion: An incredible private, beachfront estate fully stocked and staffed for the occasion. As the sun set, they enjoyed margaritas on the rocks - they were sitting on actual rocks, the margaritas were actually blended.
Back in Bel-Air, Rob kept pretending he'd never been in the house. Wade continued to ask just how Rob knew Erin, how they'd met, when they dated etcetera, but Rob kept dodging the issue with silent stares. Meanwhile, in Mexico, Erin and Chad were amazed at how comfortable they were with each other. After a candlelit dinner, guess where they decided to go? C'monâ€¦guess. If you said, &quot;&quot;Hot tub&quot;&quot; then you win!</Overview>

  <Overview>The much-awaited night of the summer came. Two guys (Wade and Chad), two hours, two million dollars on the line. Last week we saw everyone again in the reunion special. And the week before, we saw Rob get rejected by Eric for the SECOND time. Erin makes one final elimination. Wade is kicked out, leaving Chad as her choice. Chad quotes (after confessing about everything), &quot;&quot;Having said that, I am going to not take the money.&quot;&quot; Erin is so happy. She promises Chad one million dollars because he made a gamble, so now he gets both</Overview>

  <Overview>The Season 3 Premiere
Part One: The Money Game    Summer just wouldn't be the same without good-looking singles struggling between dating an equally good-looking member of the opposite sex or claiming a large cash prize. This time, however, the choice between Love or Money had some interesting new twists. First of all the 16 new women had no clue they were going to be on For Love or Money. A fleet of Mercedes G-Class SUVs whisked the anxious ladies up scenic Pacific Coast Highway to a hilltop mansion that rivaled any European castle. With jaws appropriately dropped in awe, the girls were even more surprised to see host Jordan Murphy emerge to greet them. Once they learned they were playing For Love or Money, the girls were shocked and excited.
Luckily, there were already a few girls who stood-out as troublemakers. Blonde bombshell Andrea (pronounced Ahn-dray-ah) literally ran upstairs to claim the best room and the biggest bed. Flight attendant Rachel snarled to camera, &quot;&quot;I can already</Overview>

  <Overview>In a special twist, the girls compete for a chance to get to know how much they are playing for, as well as a solo date with Preston.  PJ wins the challenge, and must not reveal to Preston.   When we last left the final six ladies, Jordan was about to divulge yet another secret. What he did was let the ladies know that not only does Preston know about their checks, but he also knows the value of their checks! This threw the girls for quite a loop. They began to rethink their last dates...and to question Preston's true motives. While some (Rachel and Andrea) were upset that the balance of power had shifted, others (Rebekah and PJ) became more determined than ever to prove to Preston that they were there for the right reasons.
Later that day, the girls rejoined Jordan in the study. There before them were their portraits lined up next to one another. The girls each stood before a box, facing their portraits. The box contained two coins, one with a heart symbol and the other with a dollar</Overview>

  <Overview>A quiet morning in the mansion was disrupted when Jordan burst into the girls' bedroom with good news and bad news. The good news was that they'd each have a chance for alone time with Preston. The bad news was that there were 5 girls, and only 4 dates. Like last season, the bachelor would choose a girl for the first date. At the end of that date, he could return to the mansion and pick up another girl for the second date, or stay with the same girl and continue the date. The news woke the girls up in a hurry and they clamored to get ready (which included some very odd shots of Rebekah shaving her entire leg). Once they were all primped and pretty, they stood out on the front porch awaiting Preston's arrival.
Preston chose Andrea for his first date, much to Rachel's obvious dismay. PJ was also frustrated. She said that Andrea rubbed her the wrong way. Meanwhile, in the limo, Preston thought Andrea looked great and he kept commenting on her great stomach. Soon they pulled up to a roller</Overview>

  <Overview>Part one of the FLOM finale!   Two out of the final four are eliminated!
Breakfast was spent on money matters. The Final Four tried to figure out the value of Rebekah's and Rachel's checks. They knew PJ was worth $50K and that Andrea was down to $250K. After breakfast Jordan met the ladies in the study. They were seated facing their portraitsâ€¦and their checks. Jordan revealed that none of the remaining four were millionaires. However, he also revealed four new mystery checks and told the ladies they would each have the chance to swap their existing check for a new one. Two of the four new checks were worth $1 million, the other two were worth $1. Neither the girls nor Preston would ever know the value of the new checks. It was one more chance to level the playing field. Plus, if a woman chose to swap her check, she would learn her previous check's value.
Rachel was randomly chosen to decide first and of course she swapped. She soon learned that her old check was only worth $1, which re</Overview>

  <Overview>While munching on muffins and eggs, PJ and Rachel marveled at how quiet the mansion was with just the two of them. I wonder if billionaire power couples discuss the same thing when they have breakfast? Rachel wondered aloud who could've possibly said anything bad about her to Preston. Gee, I don't know - EVERYBODY? PJ wisely kept her mouth shut, despite being a guilty party. Later in the event room, Jordan reminded the girls that their decision to choose love or money could change their lives. A million dollars could be within their grasps. He then revealed that one of their checks was worth a million dollars and the other was worth a dollar. PJ's instincts were telling her she was worth a million bucks, which would make her decision very difficult. Rachel, on the other hand, knew that a one-dollar check would make her choice much easier. But what if Preston had been leading them on this entire time just so he could choose the money in the end? It was a lot to think about.

  <Overview>This is the first episode of the 4th Season.
Well, neither Andrea nor Rachel got love or money in their last attempts but that didn't stop them from trying again! Both women thought they had been plucked from the 16 women on For Love or Money to return as the sole bachelorette. Meanwhile, 15 hunky men were whisked to the FLOM mansion only to discover they would be competing on For Love or Money. The men had no idea that two women would be involved. They also had no idea that Andrea and Rachel knew each other - and the game's twists - all too well.
The guys were excited by the prospect of winning a million dollars - some more than the chance to find true love. Some of the guys were very familiar with last summer's version of the game and wasted no time in educating the others. Morgan said the game was on from the moment he learned there was a shot at winning money. Mike, on the other hand, didn't think you could put a price tag on love. Jordan then surprised them with this season's twis</Overview>

  <Overview>Rachel and her eight potential cash cows, er, I mean soul mates, were now free to date and scheme without Andrea getting in the way. The remaining guys bonded at the mansion, while still trying to determine what each other's checks were worth. Josh and Mike told each other what they were &quot;&quot;worth&quot;&quot; â€“ strategy be damned! Jordan gathered the guys downstairs. Alone time with Rachel was the key to getting ahead in the game, Jordan explained. However, he continued, only one of the eight would get an alone date before the next elimination. How much would it be worth? The guys had to bid on the date with money from their check. The bidding started at $25,000, which quickly eliminated the $1 guys (Morgan and David S.).
Chris ($250,000) kicked off the bidding and kept it going. He seemed a sure winner when bidding reached $75,000, until Mike threw his hat in for $100,000. Mike's check was also worth $250,000, so he and Chris had a lot to lose. Then Alex ($500,000) jumped in for $125,000. At the la</Overview>
