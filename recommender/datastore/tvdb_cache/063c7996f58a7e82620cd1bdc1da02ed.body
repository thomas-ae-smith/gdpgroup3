The end game from the 1980 word association game Chain Reaction - a team working together to form questions for their teammate to answer - formed the premise of Go, an interesting word association game that lasted on NBC from October 3, 1983 to January 20, 1984. Two teams of four members competed, each headed by a celebrity player. The teams were always related in some way (e.g., a 21-year-old college co-ed, her aunt and uncle, and her grandfather; three brothers and their sister). One member of each team tries to answer a series of questions posed by his/her teammates. The first player sits between his teammates, who are shown a word. Working together, the two teammates form a question, adding one word at a time and ringing a bell to prompt an answer. e.g.: "What¦" "is¦"" "made¦" "up¦" "of¦</Overview>

<Overview>Matthew Perry stars as Ryan King, a recent widower and sports talk radio host ready to get back to work after the loss of his wife. Ryan's alpha-male boss, Stephen, played by John Cho, has a different plan in store for Ryan, making him attend grief counseling before returning to the air. A reluctant Ryan finds himself in a support group for "life change," where he meets an oddball cast of characters, all with their own backstories filled with varying degrees of loss.

Ryan's total lack of interest in "the healing process" proves distracting and he soon butts heads with the by-the-books group leader, Lauren, played by Tony Award-winner Laura Benanti. Back at work, Ryan is confronted with the fact that he hasn't really processed his grief and realizes Lauren and the other members of the group might be key in helping him move on.</Overview>

<Overview>Popular music shows that showcased the up-and-coming stars of the day were nothing new in 1963, indeed the BBC had led the way nearly six years earlier with 'Six-Five Special,' and ATV had countered that in 1958 with 'Oh Boy.' What made 'RSG' special was that it arrived at the same time as the British beat boom, when groups such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who were on the verge of taking the music world by storm, a time when 60's youth culture hit the streets running and swept aside all that stood in its way, a time that was fresh and exciting. The show finished in 1966 at the height of its popularity and has since gone on to attain cult status. </Overview>
