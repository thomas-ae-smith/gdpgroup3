<SeriesName>Four Idle Hands</SeriesName>
<Overview>Mike Dudds (Phil Daniels) and Pete Sutton (Ray Burdis) in mid-70s, recession-hit Britain. No qualifications, but plenty of mouth and enthusiasm - which sets the scene for a serious of six adventures, all of which were originally aimed at a tea time teen audience, many of whom were no doubt in the same boat. </Overview>
