With cameras rolling, Duncan, Ben, Jonnie and Dave set out with a list of 100 dreams: everything from kissing Rachel McAdams to Getting in the Guinness Book of World Records.

<banner>graphical/79947-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>A study in animal behaviour, it was the third in a trilogy of major series (beginning with Life on Earth) that took a broad overview of nature, rather than the more specialised surveys of Attenborough's later productions. Each of the twelve 50-minute episodes features a different aspect of the journey through life, from birth to adulthood and continuation of the species through reproduction.

The series was produced in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Service and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. The executive producer was Peter Jones and the music was composed by George Fenton.

Part of David Attenborough's 'Life' series, it was preceded by The Living Planet (1984) and followed by Life in the Freezer (1993).

<Overview>Sean Finnerty and his lovely wife, Claudia, became parents right out of high school.  Now 32, they struggle to keep their lives (and three children) under control.  Claudia is a hostess at a swank restaurant, and Sean works in the subway tunnels.  Working 9 to 5 and having three kids to maintain isn't an easy task, but they're doing the best that they can.  Oldest daughter Lily, 14, is more than a handful.  At that age where she thinks the world revolves around her, Lily devours the majority of the Finnerty's free time.  Her little brother, Jimmy, is bookish to say the least, and stays out of trouble -- for the most part.  And then there's the baby of the family, Henry, who's just a little off.  Hyperactive and mischievous, Henry is usually secondary when it comes to problematic children. Helping Sean and Claudia deal with the brood is Sean's father, Walt, a crotchety man whose idea of a learning experience is teaching the boys how to dig a hole.  If he hadn't been a father, he wo</Overview>

<Overview>After spending all of her 15 years bouncing from one foster family to another in Portland, Oregon, Lux (Britt Robertson, "Swingtown") has decided it's time to take control of her life and become an emancipated minor. Her journey through the legal maze leads Lux to her biological father, 30-something Nate "Baze" Bazile (Kristoffer Polaha, "Mad Men"), who owns a bar, lives like an aging frat-boy with two slacker roommates, and is astonished to learn that he has a teenage daughter. Lux is equally astonished when Baze reveals that her mother is Cate Cassidy (Shiri Appleby, "E.R."), a star on the local "Morning Madness" radio show, along with her on-air partner and real-life boyfriend, Ryan Thomas (Kerr Smith, "Eli Stone"). Lux has been listening to Cate's voice on the radio as long as she can remember, so she feels an instant connection with the mom she's never met. Baze takes Lux to meet Cate, who is shocked and saddened to learn that Lux has grown up in foster care, but thrilled to finally meet her beautiful daughter. When a judge decides that Lux isn't ready for emancipation and unexpectedly grants temporary joint custody to Baze and Cate, they agree to try to get past the awkwardness and make a belated attempt to give Lux the family she deserves. </Overview>

When a random incident reveals that her mother's remains have gone missing, Ka desperately searches for them. Eventually, she is able to find the remains in Kam Shek's (Kent Cheng) stone factory. Ka's love for her mother impresses Shek and his disciple Shing Yat-On (Steven Ma). On befriends Ka and helps her solve many of her problems, even finding her a job in his sister, Shing Mei-Sum's (Fala Chen) company. Ka appreciates all the things On has done for her and slowly, her lifestyle changes for the better. They grow to adore one another, but do not confess their love for each other because they were both afraid of being heartbroken and would rather keep their brother-sister-like relationship. Eventually an opportunity occurs when Shek is staying in the hospital for heart surgery. Shek has Ka become On's trainer for the marathon in his place. When On wins third place in the race and celebrates with his old running partner, Ka becomes jealous, but it is through this that they reveal their feelings for each another.

To raise awareness of the urgent need for water conservation, TVB produces a program to visit the three famous rivers in Asia including China's Yellow River, India's Ganges River and the Southeast Asian Mekong River. The purpose is to understand how these 3 rivers gave birth to 3 very different cultures. Exploring the 'water source' along the river, residents -- their life and relationship with the river.

<Overview>People come to Yellowstone primarily because of the unusual thermal features and the opportunities to view wildlife, often not realizing they are standing on one of the largest active volcanoes in the world.

In Yellowstone: Land to Life, filmmaker John Grabowska (Ribbon of Sand, Remembered Earth) presents a lyrical interpretation of the sweeping geological story of Yellowstone, from glaciation to mountain-building to the gigantic caldera of a supervolcano. Featuring breathtaking cinematography of this complex and charismatic landscape, Land to Life was filmed over two years in all seasons and delves deeply into the significance behind the scenery.

Key to the story is illuminating the intimate bonds between geology and biology -- how Yellowstone's geology influences where life exists and how it evolves. Land to Life contemplates our connection as well: humankind’s relationship to Yellowstone, the world's first and most famous national park.</Overview>

"This series is a true who's who of the great and the good in their respective fields," comments James Hunt, channel director of Sky Arts. "This style of interview is unusual and revealing, largely because each contributor is set at ease by a sense of shared experience, which makes for a very illuminating and unguarded discussion. It's a fascinating series, and we're delighted to have it on Sky Arts."

<SeriesName>Lucian Freud painted life</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/261282-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Painted Life explores the life and work of Lucian Freud, undoubtedly one of Britain's greatest artists. Freud gave his full backing to the documentary shortly before his death. Uniquely, he was filmed painting his last work, a portrait of his assistant David Dawson.

Lucian Freud: Painted Life also includes frank testimony from those who knew and loved this extraordinary personality. Members of his large family (he had at least fourteen children by a number of different women), close friends including David Hockney and Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles, his dealers, his sitters and his former lovers recall for the first time a complex man who dedicated his life to his art and who always sought to transmute paint into a vibrant living representation of humanity.

The film shows how Freud never swam with the flow and only achieved celebrity in older age. He rejected the artistic fashions of his time, sticking to figurative art and exploring portraiture, especially with regards to nude portraiture, which he explored with a depth of scrutiny that produced some of the greatest works of our time.

This documentary is both a definitive biography and a revelatory exploration of the creative process.</Overview>

<Overview>Life on Earth (1979) is an epic 13-programme series, presented by David Attenborough, offering a chronological account of the flora and fauna of planet Earth over a period of 3,500 million years. Whether recounting the first journey from the sea to the land, the development of insects and flowers, or "The First Forests" and "The Lords of the Air", Attenborough's enthusiasm is infectious.  He guides us through The Infinite Variety of life from microbes to marsupials, via an unforgettable meeting with mountain gorillas, to conclude with The Compulsive Communicators, mankind itself. 
Three years in the making, involving 1.5 million miles of travel and featuring some of the most beautiful, breathtaking and ambitious photography then seen on television, Life on Earth was the first natural history blockbuster. It redefined TV by showing that an epic, serious wildlife documentary could be a massive success. As such, it remains a true television landmark and paved the way for further entries in what became known as his Life series.</Overview>

<Overview>Over the course of the series, the seasonal effect on the continent is explored, from one of the harshest winters on the planet to the arrival of spring, which welcomes a population of ocean travelers returning to breed. Then, in the summer, creatures such as seals and penguins struggle to raise their young before winter once again sets in. At this point, the ice sheet doubles and animals must leave to find food.

David Attenborough accompanied a 20-strong crew to Antarctica and spent three years filming the series. They had to contend with monolithic glaciers and extreme weather conditions, including mountainous seas, 160 km/h blizzards and harsh temperatures.

Once again, following on from The Trials of Life, the team used the latest camera technology and techniques, and had to travel into territory that had been previously inaccessible to filmmakers.[1] For example, to photograph the wildlife of the sea, boats, divers, suspended capsules and remotely controlled cameras mounted on inflatables were used. Particularly dangerous to divers were leopard seals and other predators, so some underwater sequences necessitated the use of cages for safety. The team also used a small, steel-hulled yacht, the Damien II. It had a retractable keel, which enabled the vessel to venture into shallow bays and land camera crews on to remote islands, where they could remain in contact via radio. A steadicam was used to obtain close-ups of fighting fur seals, with another person carrying a pair of wooden poles close by, in case one of the creatures attacked the human visitors.</Overview>

The show mixed very camp humour with ludicrous situations and bizarre dance routines to great effect. The series span out of a pilot made for the series "Comic Asides" (this still exists and has been made available on the Region 0 DVD distributed by Network Videos) but sadly only one series of six episodes was made before the series was cancelled. Alan Cumming started taking higher profile movie roles whilst Forbes Masson returned to the theatre where he has gained much critical acclaim as a playwright. The show never really struck a chord with a wide audience, although it does still have a cult fanbase, but it was equally praised and derided for its breakneck pace and energy and for its use of Scots</Overview>

<SeriesName>Life. . .and Stuff</SeriesName>
<Overview>Welcome to the Life. . .and Stuff guide at TV Tome. "Life... and Stuff" centered on a husband (Rick Reynolds) and wife (Pam Dawber) who tried to keep their love-life fresh and cope with the uneasy truths of modern-day marriage.  With his stressful job as an advertising executive and her long hours as a housewife and mother, there wasn't much time for romance or meaningful conversation...so they argued and yelled a lot!  Their two sons,  Jerry and Shawn, rarely said a word, instead spending their days glued firmly to the TV set.  Rick's spaced-out unemployed kid brother, Andy, lived in a motor home in the driveway and spent his days barging in, stealing food and generally mooching from his elder sibling.  Jordan, Nancy and Bernie were Rick's co-workers at the advertising agency, and Christine was Ronnie's loopy best friend.   Based on stand-up comic Rick Reynold's critically acclaimed autobiographical one-man-show, "Only the Truth Is Funny," the show was compared to "Eve</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Simple Life</SeriesName>
<banner>blank/73230.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The Simple Life is a totally unscripted series starring everyone's favorite spoiled socialites, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie! During the shows first season, Paris and Nicole got a reality check when they learned what it was really like to live among the middle-class as they moved from their posh Beverly Hills pads to the small town of Altus, Arkansas (population 817) for a one-month stay. Paris and Nicole were horribly inept at their jobs, which were the first they had ever had-including gigs at a dairy farm and a fast-food joint. But pretty soon they were up to their old tricks, picking up guys and causing mischief along the way, all in an effort to spice up the lives of their small town family and to win the hearts of the town's simple, kind-hearted residents. In the end, the girls survived the challenge, and most certainly served to prove that you can take the girl out of the city, but you can't take the city out of the girl!</Overview>
