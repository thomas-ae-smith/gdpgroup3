<SeriesName>The New Yogi Bear Show</SeriesName>
<banner>text/90151.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The New Yogi Bear Show was a 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication in 1988 and featured one of Hanna-Barbera's most classical characters, Yogi Bear. It contained 45 new shorts combined with reruns of The Yogi Bear Show from 1961-1963.

Pared down from some of the other, recent incarnations of the adventures of Yogi and his friends, this series featured only Yogi, Boo Boo, Cindy and Ranger Smith, with the episodes set in Jellystone Park.

This series also introduced three new characters: Ranger Roubideux (the Ranger Smith's assistant, who's chubby and tiny-sized), Ninja Raccoon (a Japanese raccoon cub, who wears a kimono) and Blubber Bear from Wacky Races (a large grizzly bear, who's taller than Yogi).</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Adventures of Paddington Bear</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/70613-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>After bidding farewell to his Aunt Lucy in darkest Peru, Paddington Bear sails off and eventually finds himself alone in Paddington Station. The label around his neck reads simply: "Please look after this bear. Thank You." When the Brown family takes him in, they get a lot more than they bargained for.

Paddington is a stranger in a strange land and much of the charm of his adventures comes from his unique way of looking at the world. Many things others take for granted are exactly what he finds so fascinating and worthy of investigation.

Paddington Bear has a knack for turning everyday life into an all-out adventure. Helpful and curious, Paddington always puts his paws where he shouldn't and inevitably finds himself in sticky situations. He doesn't go looking for adventure, it just seems to find him!

But that's part of his charm: Who else could take first prize at the dance contest without knowing the first thing about dancing? Who else could win the Tour de France — on a tricycle? And who else could inadvertently become a guest speaker at the White House?

Why Paddington, of course!</Overview>
