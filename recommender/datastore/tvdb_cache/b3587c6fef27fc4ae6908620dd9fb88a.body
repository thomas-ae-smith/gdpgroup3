    <Overview>Hard on the heels of his award winning series South, Marcus Lush is now turning his attention to the north.

This 10 episode series will see Marcus traverse the North Island from Auckland to the Far North and Cape Reinga, visiting the Islands of the Gulf, and telling the stories of the great harbours of the Manukau, Hokianga, Kaipara and the Waitemata. In many cases he will be taking the road less travelled, via sand-barge, cement ship, on horseback or small local fishing vessels.

To tell these stories Marcus will seek real grass-roots characters, real people of the land. This is a series where New Zealanders tell the tales of what's gone before, tell their own personal stories and share with the rest of the country their love and passion for the area they call home.</Overview>
