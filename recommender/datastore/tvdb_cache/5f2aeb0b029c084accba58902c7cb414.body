  <Overview>The series Wings, could best be described as Cheers 2, as it followed much the same pattern as the other series did. The similarities are numerous, such as both being easy going character comedies and being produced by the same team (David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee). The main difference being the setting. Instead of a Boston bar being the main setting, a small airport terminal on the island of Nantucket was used as the main backdrop.

The regular &quot;gang&quot; included brothers Joe and Brian Hackett, both pilots, who ran a one-plane local cummuter service called Sandpiper Air. They had little else in common. Joe was button-down, organized and serious, and Brian, a hang loose, free spirit. Thier mutual best friend since childhood was Helen, a once chubby but now beautiful aspiring concert cellist who ran the lunch counter. These three lifelong friends were the &quot;three musketeers&quot;.

The other regulars included, Faye, Sandpipers rather flighty but always perky, sixtyish ex-stewardess who ran the ticket counter; Lowell Mather, the eccentric airport mechanic and Roy, the loud mouth blow hard who ran rival airline Aeromass.</Overview>

  <Overview>For the upcoming model show, Lowell brings in his most prized possession, his radio controlled Graf Zeppelin model. Storing it in Joe's office he makes only one request, that no one touch it, including Joe. But Joe can't resist and of course destroys it, after Roy bursts in without knocking and crushes it behind the door.
Meanwhile, Brian's attempt at cheering Fay up by letting her beat him in a game of tennis, turns into embarrassment as the news of the victory spreads. So Brian, with wounded pride, challenges Fay to a rematch, but bows out when he realizes that he can't beat her. So he fakes an injury to save face.
Helen confronts Roy about not hiring any female pilots, so he claims that a male looking pilot is actually female. When Helen finally gets the nerve to ask him he is female, he says no. Roy says he was just playing mind games.</Overview>
