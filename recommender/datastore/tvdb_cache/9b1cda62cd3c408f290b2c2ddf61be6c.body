<SeriesName>Naked and Funny</SeriesName>
<Overview>Naked &amp; Funny is a TV series from Ukraine featuring hidden camera sketches.[1] They usually include public unexpected softcore nudity and/or exhibitionism.[2] The series is broadcast on TV channels in several other countries, e.g. on Germany's Comedy Central.[3].
There are two types of sketches. The more common is a sexy girl or sexually awkward person appears and people's reactions are filmed. The other variant is where a prank is played on an unsuspecting person. This usually involves the victim removing their clothes for in either a changing room or for some other purpose.
Many if not all the episodes seem to be fake[citation needed]. There appear to be 3 or 4 cameras that focus on the victim or model, which could not be hidden. Even more, they move in accordance with the movements of the actor and the supposed victim. Cameras always record faces, the naked body of the actress, etc. The victims almost always accept the supposed prank without complaint. Although they are recorded, supposedly, in Ukraine with ordinary people, signs are in English (obviously to facilitate international distribution of the episodes).</Overview>

<SeriesName>Naked Britain</SeriesName>
<Overview>This three part series follows Dr Jack Lewis as he travels the breath and length of Britain to see if Blighty really is as prudish and squeamish as our stuffy-nosed international reputation suggests.

That isn't to say Dr Jack is a bastion of hippy, free-loving, 'get-your-kit-off' exhibitionism though and he's forced to not only attempt to make the great British public open up about their bodies, but confront his own prejudices along the way.

This light-hearted, highly amusing series sees Dr Jack explore the world of naturism, the relationship between nudity and art, and the seemingly geneological nationalistic inherency of finding everything nudey very very naughty.

As Jack himself says: “Nudity is such a complex subject. When you’re a kid, you have no inhibitions, but then puberty happens and the shyness kicks in. Britain also makes an unwavering connection between nudity and sex. Scandinavian countries are more open-minded, and are able to separate non-sexual nudity from the sexual. The British can’t, it’s the Victorian hangover.”

Right, who's up for a bit of streaking then?

<Overview>In this documentary series shot on location in Egypt, Israel and Greece, the two-time Emmy Award winning producer and director Simcha Jacobovici digs deep into the most extraordinary finds in the Middle East, showing viewers Biblical archaeology like they've never seen it before: He dances, he raps, he clambers under barbed wire and over fences - and he crosses swords with the world's foremost archaeologists, historians and scientists.

Fast, funny and irreverent (think the Ali G. of archaeology), Jacobovici asks the questions we all want to know the answers to: Why is it so bad to be called a Philistine? Was Jezebel really that sexy? What do you do when you find a 2,000-year-old palace under your house? And where do you stop for a good falafel when you're on your way to find the real Mount Sinai?</Overview>
