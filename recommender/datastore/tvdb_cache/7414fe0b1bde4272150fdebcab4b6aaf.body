  <Overview>Nikita is assigned to evaluate Karyn, a recruit who is nearing the end of her two year training period. During her first live mission, Karyn kills her mentor, Brian, in cold-blood. When Nikita confronts her, Karyn confides that Brian had repeatedly raped her during her training. This reason, coupled with the fact that everyone in Section One seems to like Karyn, makes Nikita more insecure about her decision whether Karyn should have full status or be cancelled. Nikita realizes that Karyn is definitely not Section material when Karyn exhibits psychotic behaviors during a mission and decides that Karyn should be cancelled. Operations and Madeline inform her that Karyn was already set for cancellation, they were just testing Nikita and if she had made the wrong decision, she too would have probably been cancelled.</Overview>

  <Overview>When Nikita is sent to investigate a bartender at a posh club who may be a terrorist contact, he responds to her questioning by leaping from the 65th floor window to his death. A search of his apartment turns up a strange helmet-like device, which Section later discovers is used for brainwashing. Unfortunately, Nikita has used the device several times in an effort to discover what it is, and now it is in control of her mind. When Nikita and other operatives are assigned to protect the Premier of China from other similarly brainwashed individuals, Section has no idea that the greatest threat to the Premier is Nikita herself.</Overview>

  <Overview>Jovan Mijovich has been elected as premier of his new nation, but there is a hit man out to assassinate him. Nikita and Michael, along with other Section One operatives, are dispatched to provide security. During the inaugural celebration, the hit man is taken out, but a hostage situation develops that no one expected. A man, Bruner, claims Mijovich raped and blinded his daughter during the nation's civil war, and threatens to kill him. Nikita tries to defuse the situation, and manages to keep Mijovich alive for the time being, but when Bruner's daughter appears to give her side of the story, the accuracy of her testimony will mean the difference between peace and war for her people.</Overview>

After Tyler kidnaps a young inventor who has created a new, completely un-detectable plastic explosive, Nikita is sent to try and rescue the inventor and keep his knowledge out of Tyler's hands. When the mission is unsuccessful, Nikita is given orders to cancel the inventor, but she refuses.

  <Overview>With Adrian's help, Nikita manages to breach the most sensitive area of Section and secure a file, code named Gemstone, which contains evidence which will bring down Operations and destroy Section One. Meanwhile, Operations forces Michael to identify the Section operative most likely to work with Adrian to undermine Section, Nikita. Michael confronts Nikita in order to try to find a way to protect her, but she denies any association with Adrian. Now Michael is forced to kidnap both Nikita and Adrian and bring them back to Section, knowing that Nikita and Adrian will be cancelled and that the incriminating Gemstone file will be permanently erased.</Overview>

Madeline, posing as a therapist taking over Corinne's case, and Michael, posing as a therapist slowly drive Corinne insane using a highly addictive &quot;&quot;medication&quot;&quot; which makes her extremely unstable and an altered videotape making it appear Nikolai was having an affair with Nikita.  According to the mission profile, Corinne takes her husband's life.</Overview>

  <Overview>Brothers Karl and Simon Peruze are responsible for some of the most vicious attacks on civilians ever recorded. Eliminating both of them proves difficult, since neither brother would ever give up the other. Section One kidnaps Karl, wipes clean his short-term memory, and places Nikita with him when he comes to, so she can pose as his fiancee and lead Section to Simon. Strangely, the more Nikita learns about Karl's cruel history, the more she is drawn to him, falling in love with him. However, Nikita's slowly dawning realization that her mind is being controlled by Section threatens to unravel the entire mission.</Overview>

  <Overview>On an operation to get industrialist and terrorist financier Charles Meyer, Nikita is sent to a &quot;modeling agency&quot; run by Amalin Anagar, which is in reality, not just a brothel, but also an arena where beautiful girls are forced to fight each other to the death in a place called &quot;The Pit&quot; While undercover at Anagar's, Nikita tries to protect a naive young girl named Sondra from fighting in &quot;&quot;The Pit,&quot;&quot; while also trying to figure out a way to save all the girls at Anagar's (an objective which is not in the mission profile). Meanwhile, Madeline appears to be jealous of Renee from Oversight who is visiting Section One. She may have reason to be, as Renee immediately puts moves on the very willing Operations.</Overview>

  <Overview>This time, Section is out to get an outfit by the name of The Alliance, and Section's way in is a psychotic courier by the name of Jan Bailin. Bailin has other plans and she kills herself before the Section can use her. So, as a backup, Section employs a meek, terminally ill lookalike for Bailin by the name of Sarah Gerrard. As she trains her, Nikita starts to get suspicious, did Section purposely make Sarah ill to make it easier for Section to convince Sarah to work for them? And if so, will Section even let Sarah live if she completes the mission?</Overview>

  <Overview>After an operation against a terrorist group, Michael brings one of the terrorists back to the Section for questioning. The &quot;capture&quot; is a plant, and he knocks Madeline out during interrogation and runs amuck in Section One's HQ. Before Michael finds and eliminates the man, he successfully uploads many of Section One's crucial files, including the Registry (which is at least encrypted, and will take the terrorists several days to decipher) and the exact location (un-encrypted) of Section's HQ (located in Paris). Operations orders the evacuation and destruction of Section One's HQ. With Section in temporary quarters, Operations takes over the counter-operation personally, and goes out on a mission with a less than thrilled Nikita. Will Operations be able to find the terrorist base before the terrorists decode The Registry?</Overview>

  <Overview>With the &quot;situation in the Balkans&quot; again reaching critical, Operations is called off on a consulting job in the field by &quot;The Center,&quot; and he turns over temporary full control of Section One to Michael. Operations leaves Michael with one warning, George from Oversight wants a full-scale campaign waged against terrorist financier Luigi Bergomi, but Michael must resist this as Bergomi is too strong and would overwhelm Section forces. After meeting with George, Michael has a change of heart, and decides to launch an operation against Bergomi, despite Madeline's and later Nikita's strong objections. Has the absolute power of running Section One gone to Michael's head? Meanwhile, now that they are &quot;officially&quot; lovers, Michael promotes Nikita as his lieutenant over another agent named Wallace, and when Wallace turns up dead after an operation against Bergomi, Nikita wonders if Michael is playing favorites, and trying to protect her.</Overview>

  <Overview>Madeline has decided that Michael's romantic involvement with Nikita is affecting his performance, and so she sets about putting pressure on Michael to halt the relationship. Soon enough, Michael is no longer in charge of Tactical Oversight, so he loses his office, and is no longer running missions. He's replaced by Davenport, a decent guy who's now in charge of field operations. Can Michael give up all the power he's earned in Section One for Nikita? And will Nikita let him give it all up, even if he wants to? Meanwhile, a sultry operative by the name of Valerie is putting heavy moves on both Walter and Birkoff, which soon enough puts a strain on their friendship.</Overview>

  <Overview>After Birkoff chokes in the middle of remotely directing an operation and is then promptly upstaged by arch-nemesis Greg Hillinger who pulls the frying pan out of the fire and saves the mission, Operations promotes Hillinger to Birkoff's job and re-assigns Birkoff to his first field operation. Birkoff's mission is to infiltrate and perform reconnaissance on a mercenary terrorist organization &quot;Soldat de la Liberty&quot; run by a man named Jean-Marc Rousseau who employs brainwashing on young people to fill the ranks of his organization. Birkoff is convinced that Operation's real objective is to set him up with an impossible mission, so that Operations can eliminate Birkoff and permanently replace him with the more obsequious and pliable Hillinger. And sure enough, once inside the group Birkoff discovers ties between Rousseau's organization and the infamous Red Cell, and Operations refuses to extricate Birkoff preferring to leave him in place to gather more information.

  <Overview>During an operation, Hillinger's goofing off costs an operative his life, and Hillinger pleads with Birkoff to cover for him, which Birkoff inexplicably does. Hillinger doesn't return the favor, however, when Birkoff is sent out to direct a mission from the field, and Hillinger deliberately tries to get his rival Birkoff killed off once and for all. The jokes on Hillinger when Birkoff exposes what Hillinger did. Sure enough, Operations puts him in abeyance and Hillinger's days seem to be numbered. At the same time, Operations is acting more and more viciously toward Madeline. Operations' timing is terrible, as George from Oversight is turning up the pressure on Operations, just as he's acting out with Madeline. Will Madeline get even with Operations by betraying him to George?</Overview>

  <Overview>Literally playing with fire, Michael and Nikita are setting up clandestine rendezvous on Section missions as a way to get around Operations and Madeline's ban on their seeing each other (See Third Party Ripoff). Operations and Madeline still suspect Michael and Nikita of seeing each other on the side, so Madeline starts sending Davenport along on Michael's and Nikita's mission to spy on them. Meanwhile, Madeline orders Birkoff to sweep Michael's and Nikita's computer panels for secret communication, and when Birkoff does indeed discover communications between the two, it implicates Walter as their go-between. Will Birkoff turn in Walter? And, if so, what will happen to Michael, Nikita and Walter?</Overview>

  <Overview>The unbelievable happens! Nikita is called before Operations and Madeline and is given fantastic news, she's free! As part of a &quot;&quot;pilot program,&quot;&quot; Nikita is granted her freedom and a normal life, as long as she never contacts anyone from Section again, and as long as she agrees to be regularly evaluated. Nikita is skeptical at first, but after 6 weeks on &quot;&quot;the outside,&quot;&quot; she starts to believe that maybe this is for-real. Sure enough, George from Oversight shows up with the strings, in exchange for her freedom, Nikita must do one thing, return to Section One to kill Operations! The man whom George claims killed Nikita's real father. Will Nikita do it?</Overview>

  <Overview>Another incursion takes place in Section One, this time in the form of a virus that is making Section One's members sick, one by one. Taking matters into his own hands, George orders in his own Bio Team to treat Section's members. Operations suspects George has an ulterior motive. Sure enough, when Section's people, starting with Walter, followed by Nikita, go in for their &quot;&quot;examination&quot;&quot; with George's Bio Team, they come out vegetables. It seems George's team is mind wiping (downloading the contents of the brains) the Section's members. This process causes them to relive their lives, before leaving them vegetables. Can Michael and Birkoff stop George's team before everyone in Section One gets their brain sucked?</Overview>

  <Overview>Seeking a lost command clone (a computer-like device that apparently allows the user to command a Section without outside aide) that was apparently captured by Red Cell and then stolen by another terrorist group, George and Oversight orders Section one to work together with an agent from Section Four to search for the missing &quot;&quot;command clone.&quot;&quot; What is Section Four? Apparently, it's the Section where people/agents with extrasensory abilities are developed. So, who is the agent from Section Four? None other than a 12-year old boy by the name of Gerome. Of course, with his extrasensory abilities, Gerome soon overwhelms the ability of Madeline and Operations to control him. Can Nikita bring Gerome under control before he destroys Section One?</Overview>

  <Overview>Operations gives Michael and Nikita an almost impossible task; they must get five absolutely, brand spankin' new recruits (Aaron Ashmore, ClÃ© Bennett, Kira Clavell, Megan Fahlenbock, Brian Poth) up to full, field-level operatives, in a very short amount of time! They must go up against new terrorist group, Crystal Sky (who recently did a number on Section Eight). Nikita doesn't think it can be done. Is this another of Operation's gambits, in which the five new recruits are cannon fodder for some mission? If so, can Michael and Nikita save them from this fate? And, if these recruits aren't ready by the time of the mission, could their inexperience also put Michael and Nikita themselves in peril?</Overview>

  <Overview>Birkoff may have stumbled on Section One's biggest coups yet, a chance to nab a top Red Cell operative by the name of &quot;The Cardinal&quot;, who has eluded Section One for more than 15 years. Unfortunately, Birkoff's arch-nemesis Greg Hillinger is convinced that Birkoff is wrong, and Hillinger convinces George that Operations and Section One are walking into a trap. Based on Hillinger's intellect, George moves against Operations on the assumption that the operation against The Cardinal is bogus. Is Birkoff right after all? And if Birkoff is wrong, is this the end of Operations, and Birkoff too?</Overview>

  <Overview>Birkoff creates an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) program to serve as his replacement, when he's away. In fact, Birkoff is up for a large batch of downtime, when a critical situation arises and Operations cancels Birkoff's downtime. Birkoff's A.I. program, which is just a little too attached to old Seymour, doesn't take this news well, and proceeds to take matters into its own hands. The A.I.'s solution to Birkoff's predicament is to kill everyone in Section One, except Nikita, so Birkoff can escape with Nikita as his companion. Can Birkoff save Section One before his A.I. program carries out it's insane plan?</Overview>

  <Overview>Nikita is injected with a psychotic drug. It causes her to think &amp; see things that don't happen. For instance, when she was eating in a restaurant, she sees a guy coming with a knife towards the other man, but it never happens. She sees blood on her hands one minute, then the next, it is gone. She was given this drug to help her get into the institution, where Crystal French's son, David French, is at. Nikita still has the drug in her body, so Michael gets her out of mission before something bad happens. She receives electroshock therapy causing her to forget the mission. Nikita falls asleep, thinking she is still in the Institution, but she is safe in her apartment again.</Overview>

When George is eliminated from the picture after leaking intel to Red Cell in order to discredit Section One, the newly-empowered Operations and Madeline finally track down Michael and Nikita. They bring them back to Section. Just as Michael and Nikita are about to be cancelled, all of Section's systems suddenly stop.

  <Overview>Nikita finds clues about why she was recruited into Section. Is it possible her father was an operative, codenamed Flavius, and that she has a sibling with the initial &quot;M&quot; who is somewhere in the covert world she lives in? Quinn redesigns Birkoff's Artificial Intelligence program to build a holographic replica of Madeline, complete with Madeline's memories and psychological profile.  Although Operations is greatly pleased to have Madeline at his side once more, it soon becomes clear that despite it's complex programming, it is just not capable of being Madeline because it doesn't have her instincts.</Overview>

  <Overview>After the explosion at the house of Nikita's father, Nikita enlists Walter, and then Jason Crawford, to decript its contents. The result; the location of the convelecence home where Michael took Adrian after the &quot;Gelman Process&quot; mess. And this just happens to coincide with Nikita's physical deterioration because of her experience with the &quot;Gelman Process.&quot; Has Michael or Nikita's real father given her the information she needs to beat these after effects? Or is Nikita inevitably heading to the same place Adrian ended up, namely the grave? Meanwhile, O'Brien betrays Nikita, by revealing her deteriorating health to Operations, but unsure that O'Brien will be able to resist Nikita's &quot;charms&quot; any more than Michael did. Operations 'shadows' O'Brien with his very own 'pit bull' operative, Golliak. And Section One continues to try and crack &quot;The Collective.&quot;</Overview>

  <Overview>Nikita finally comes face to face with her father, the real Mr. Jones, but rather than being an &quot;emotional&quot; reunion, Mr. Jones is all business, and immediately sets Nikita out on a new mission; finding The Collective's &quot;mole&quot; in Section One! Mr. Jones' two candidates: Operations or Marco O'Brien. Mr. Jones thinks it's the latter, but Nikita suspects the former. So Nikita sets out to find the &quot;mole.&quot; Meanwhile, the two co-heads of The Collective, Graff and Haled clash over tactics, and whether to trust their &quot;mole's&quot; intel about Section One. Michael finally turns up, but not until the last scene!</Overview>

  <Overview>Nikita and Mr. Jones have The Collective's &quot;mole&quot; narrowed down to four suspects: Operations, Quinn, Walter and the late Marco O'Brien, but Mr. Jones has a fifth possibility that Michael Samuelle is still alive, and that he is the &quot;mole.&quot; While granting to Mr. Jones the theoretical possibility that Michael may be alive, Nikita denies that he would never be the &quot;mole&quot; for The Collective, Graff and Haled. Meanwhile, Operations sets out personally to see to it that an anti-Collective mission goes according to plan, but it's The Collective that is poised to blow Operations' plane out of the sky! Can and will Nikita save Operations' butt, one last time or should she even bother?</Overview>
