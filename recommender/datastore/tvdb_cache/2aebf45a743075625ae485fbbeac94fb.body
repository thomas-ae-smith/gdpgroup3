<Overview>Crash Course is a series of educational videos covering World History (John) and Biology (Hank). The production values are high (including animation, HD, all that good stuff), and each video is about ten minutes long. My favorites so far are John’s videos on World History — he promises a 40-part series (co-written with his high school history teacher), though only three parts have been posted so far. Check ‘em out below.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Crash Test</SeriesName>
<Overview>In Crash Test, two contestants go head-to-head to attempt to crash an event which could be anything from a birthday party to an athletic showcase. Before going in, the contestants are each provided with a list of stunts which can be performed for points. Stunts are divided into point values of 10, 50 and 100 points. Some stunts can be performed for points multiple times, while others, by their nature, can only be performed once. A stunt that is attempted but failed earns no points. Finally, the contestants must remember that if at any time they are caught, they lose 100 points and will be ineligible to do any further stunts. The objective for each event is to outscore the other player. If you do, you continue to return to attempt to crash future events, but if you fail, you are out of the game completely. If two contestants tie, then both get to return to compete again. Additionally, there is one stunt each time called the "Wild Card" - a stunt so ballsy that if a contestant succe</Overview>
