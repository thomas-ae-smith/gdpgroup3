The First World War has just erupted when a group of youth gather in the port of Barcelona to catch a ship that will never sail. There is where Karl and Gloria meet each other, sharing the wait with Sebastian and Caterina, a couple of young farmers, Cinto, a hustler who knows no boundaries, and Maria who dreams reaching the music hall world.
