<SeriesName>Aliens in the Family</SeriesName>
<Overview>In this ABC cute-com, which was derived from The Brady Bunch and Jim Henson's previous prime-time outing, Dinosaurs, the Henson company introduced us to a family oriented show consisting of a blended family -- half-aliens and half humans.  Each sickeningly sweet episode wrapped with a moral.  The aliens, with the exception of mother Cookie, were played by giant Muppets from Jim Henson's Creature Shop.   
Aliens in the Family is the story of a big-hearted human dad, Doug Brody, who was abducted by a spacecraft, fell in love with an alien single mom, Cookie, and returned to Earth to marry her and raise their unusual brood of human and alien children. Doug's two human kids, nine-year-old Adam and 14-year-old self-obsessed Heather, are alternately delighted and exasperated by their three extraterrestrial siblings”their brother Spit, 14, who was prone to grossing everyone out; bookish sister Snizzy, 10, who was reminiscent of Velma Dinkley from "Scooby Doo"; and baby brother Bobut</Overview>

<Overview>A Wisconsin mom arranges to host a foreign exchange student, believing the visitor will help her shy son become more popular. When the student turns out to be a Muslim teenager from Pakistan, her plans go awry--and everyone is likely to learn a little lesson about life.

Justin Tolchuk (Dan Byrd, "The Hill Have Eyes") is a lanky, sensitive 16 year old trying to make it through high school in Medora, Wisconsin with help from his aspiring-entrepreneur Dad (Scott Patterson, "Gilmore Girls"), his popular sister Claire (Lindsey Shaw, "Ned's Defied School Survival Guide"), and his loving mom, Franny (Amy Pietz, "Caroline in the City"). Franny signs up for the school's international exchange student program, and expects an athletic, brilliant Nordic teen to help her outsider son become cool, but instead, she receives a 16-year-old Pakistani Muslim student when he arrives. Despite their cultural differences Justin and Raja quickly befriend one another. The unlikely friendship may help the two navigate the minefield that is high school. It is going to be an interesting year for Raja, Justin, his family and the entire population of Medora.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Calling All Aliens</SeriesName>
<Overview>It is one of the biggest mysteries of our time: Are we alone in the universe? Hollywood has already given its own answer. After close encounters of the third kind such as “E.T.”, scientists have now taken up the hunt for real aliens. Since 1977, a golden gramophone record has been travelling through space. The Voyager record contains greetings in 55 languages and music from Mother Earth. 30 years later, some researchers even want to load human DNA on a rocket. But this plan is causing trouble. In a worst case scenario, we are inviting hostile invaders to take control over the earth. Do we really want to give away our most important secret to everybody? The two part documentary shows us a world where science and fantasy mingle, and where fictions inspire real research. CALLING ALL ALIENS shows the desperate yet hopeful believers behind their monstrous telescopes. In 2007, their search will reach a new dimension. With 350 satellite dishes, each one measuring six meters in diameter, the world’s most gigantic telescope array ever built will be tuned in to detect the message that could change the world. Director Christian Schidlowski has exclusive access. His uncle is one of the world’s leading experts on our cosmos.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Ancient Aliens</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/101501-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Is it possible that intelligent life forms visited Earth thousands of years ago, bringing with them technology that drastically affected the course of history and man’s own development?

Presented in the 1968 bestselling book Chariots of the Gods, by Erich von Daniken, the theory of “ancient aliens” rocked people’s beliefs in mankind’s progress. Ancient cave drawings of strange creatures, remains of landing strips in Peru, and Indian texts that describe the “flying machines of the gods” were just a few of the odd archaeological artifacts cited by von Daniken as proof that ancient astronauts were well known to our ancestors.

Produced with the exclusive cooperation of von Daniken himself, the documentary series Ancient Aliens launches all-new expeditions to seek out and evaluate this evidence, with a concentration on discoveries of the last 30 years, including unusual DNA findings on man’s evolution and newly decoded artifacts from Egypt to Syria to South America. It is a balanced investigation into a theory some believe cannot be true, but many agree cannot be ignored.
