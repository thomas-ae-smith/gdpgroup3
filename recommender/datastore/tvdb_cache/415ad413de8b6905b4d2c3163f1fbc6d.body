<Overview>In a busy corporate law firm, Cooper-Fozard in the City of London, Stephen Bradley and his team work fast and furiously to put together mergers, takeovers and buyouts for a range of clients. But it's never as clear and clinical as that. When colleagues work hard they often play hard too; and working closely sometimes brings people together after hours. 

Soon you develop a taste for a good deal, and you can sense a suspicious one at forty paces. And above all, though you don't have to like the people you work with, you learn that you do need to trust them.

Trust is a pacy precinct drama with sharply drawn and witty characters facing challenging personal and professional situations against a dramatic backdrop of contemporary London.</Overview>

Mr Bateman acts as a go-between who goes between the two booths. The idea is he drip-feeds new information to each team about their opponents every time he visits. 

When Nick arrives in a room, he tells the people in there what money is available. They then have three options. They can take the cash for themselves, leaving the other booth with nothing and the game will end. Or, they could split the cash with the other booth and game will end. Or, they could go on, in which case more money is added and offered to the other booth, who then get information about whoever is in Box A</Overview>
