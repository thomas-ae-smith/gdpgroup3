  <Overview>Created by infamous broadcaster and celebrity Chris Evans, 'Boys and Girls' was a Saturday evening entertainment show with a difference. With a target audience of 16 - 25 year olds, this was one incredibly lively and exciting TV Show. The premise of the show was 100 boys, 100 girls all in one studio and all battling it out. Three audience members of the same sex performed to the whole studio - the other audience members of the opposite sex would vote to decide who was thier favourite, this person was a 'contestant'. They were then able to pick two people of the opposite sex to take with them. All three were then taken to the Boys and Girls appartment, in the center of London, to stay for a week. In this week, they were given a certain ammount of money to spend each day.

  <Overview>This was the debut episode of brand new Channel 4 programme &quot;&quot;Boys and Girls&quot;&quot;. After months of promotion, this series was very highly anticipated. The show kicked off with three celebrity guest appearances from singer Dannii Minogue, Big Brother 3 contestant Jade Goody and actor Jeremey Edwards who has starred in shows like &quot;&quot;Holby City&quot;&quot;. Host Vernon Kay set out the rules of the series to home audience, and introduced Co-Presenter Orla O'Rourke.
The first contestant was picked at random, and took to the stage to pick two girls he wanted to take with him for his week in the Boys and Girls flat. There was also a &quot;&quot;Babe or Minger&quot;&quot; vote. The show ended with the first three contestants of the series leaving the studio and heading for the Boys and Girls flat in the center of London.</Overview>

  <Overview>The final episode ever of Boys and Girls! There was a suprise twist in store for the audience, however. A quiz was set-up so that the 100 girls and 100 boys were in direct competition. The boys one, and they had a decision to make. They could either select one person to take on the final challenge or, they could split the £100,000 jackpot between them all and get a cool £1,000 each! They go for the second option. All they have to do is predict how a &quot;&quot;Babe or Minger&quot;&quot; vote would go. The subjects were Vernon, O'rla (the two hosts!) and Vernon's mum and dad! They predict it all correct and win themselves £1,000 each.</Overview>
