    <Overview>Harry Springer (Tim Healey) and Duggie Strachan (Clive Russell) are ex-Army pals who served in the Falkland Islands together.

Duggie was an infantryman, up at the 'sharp end', while Harry was in the Catering Corps.

Harry saved Duggie's life - at least, that's what Harry reckons.

Nowadays, Harry is the proud owner of the seedy Olympic Hotel in Smethwick and Duggie, now a teacher, is one of his reluctant guests.

The hotel is populated mainly by drunks, homeless people on Social Security, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. </Overview>
