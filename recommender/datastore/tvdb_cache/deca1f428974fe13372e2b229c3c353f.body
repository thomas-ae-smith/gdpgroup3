"Our goal was to create a new and distinctive series for Jesse that is unlike anything else on television," said Levy.

"In this series, viewers will get to experience one of the most fearless guys on the planet in an entirely new way, taking on death-defying physical challenges each week." Each episode will follow James as he readies himself for a different death-defying challenge. Preparing for the risky challenge can often be as dangerous as the challenge itself as he endures a battery of tests to prepare.

With CGI effects, viewers get a taste of the enormity of the stunt, revealing the physiological stress James' body will endure. Some of the dangerous challenges he'll be facing include the harrowing, grueling and lawless off-road race, the Baja 500, and hitting over 200 mph on a Nitro bike supercharged by ultra-combustible nitro-methane fuel. Ten weekly one-hour episodes of "Jesse James Is A Dead Man" will be produced by BASE Productions ("Sports Science", "Fight Science") with Jesse James and his production company, Payupsucker Productions, serving as an executive producer.</Overview>
