<SeriesName>The Angry Video Game Nerd</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/85287-g3.jpg</banner>
<Overview>A foul-mouthed nerd reviews bad video games. The titular Nerd character is an ill-tempered and foul-mouthed video game fanatic. He derives comic appeal from excessive and inventive use of profanity, frequent displays of explicit gestures, and heavy consumption of beer, particularly Rolling Rock or Yuengling, to "soothe the pain". A particular characteristic is his favorable comparison of extremely repulsive and painful, usually firmly scatological, acts to playing the games he reviews. Varying amounts of physical comedy are mixed into the verbal abuse.</Overview>

<Overview>Welcome to The Newlywed Game guide at TV Tome.       "Once upon a time, there was this nice, family TV game show on CBS called Password, wherein teams of two tried to guess words using just one word. It did very well in the ratings, and was quite educational, too.
      "Then, one day  July 11, 1966, to be exact  a CBS News special report about Robert McNamara reporting on the Vietnam War pre-empted Password. That didn't make people very happy. So, they turned the station to see what else was on.
      "Some people saw a game unlike what they had ever seen before. There was this handsome young man asking four newlywed couples questions about their marriages. Sometimes, you saw just the beautiful young ladies; and other times, the good-looking men were on, but they always got back together to talk about their marriages.

<SeriesName>The Dating Game</SeriesName>
<Overview>THE DATING GAME was and still is by all accounts, the premiere game show for singles. It was the forerunner for many imitators, such as "Love Connection", MTV's "Singled Out" and numerous others. But they all have the same influence: Chuck Barris, the creator of the one that started it all!  "THE DATING GAME" first premiered on December 20-24, 1965 on ABC-TV and remained a fixture on the network in both daytime and nighttime incarnations through the rest of the 1960s and well into the 1970s.  Jim Lange, fresh from his announcing duties with Tennessee Ernie Ford, stepped through the flower-speckled rotating partitions for the first of many, many times shortly before Christmas 1965.  The game play was simple. On one side you had 3 bachelors answering questions from a girl on the other side of the partition (each not being able to see the other). The girl was given a certain amount of time to ask as many questions as she could to the 3 bachelors. More often than not, the qu</Overview>

<Overview>Welcome to the newly-realigned NFL Game of the Week guide at TV Tome. Those of you who watch NFL Network and see the NFL Game of the Week are probably asking, What makes an NFL Game of the Week? There are many factors involved.  It could be a record-setting performance or a great rivalry.  Most of the time, it is the games that go down to the final seconds. Starting in 1965, NFL Films produced NFL Game of the Week to showcase the league's biggest contest.  It started out as the last reminder of the old newsreels.  These shows were packaged for air less than 24 hours after the game was played.  This was the pattern established for the show's first 22 years (1965-1986). Production of the old NFL Game of the Week presented its drawbacks.  Facilities were so primitive that the slightest mistake in a narration meant starting over.  This did not sit well with the proven sportscasters brought in to narrate the shows. NFL Game of the Week found its mark around 1970, wh</Overview>

<Overview>The video game revolution has been under way for decades, progressing from simple amusements created in the 1950s to an all-pervasive force in today's popular culture that rivals — and will perhaps soon surpass — film and television. What began as a subculture pastime has evolved and transcended genres to become a unique form of expression impacting everything from modern warfare to interpersonal relationships.

Rise of the Video Game is a comprehensive and progressive exploration of the past, present and future of video games and video gamers. From the early days of Pong to today's ever-popular Halo 2, and from Atari 2600 to Nintendo to PlayStation, Rise of the Video Game tells the story of the people, the ideologies and the technology behind video games and how they have exploded into a cultural phenomenon. The evolution of gaming has seen the pendulum move from the days of games replicating society, to society replicating games. Featuring interviews with giants in the gaming industry of yesterday and today, this five-part series examines the evolution of the video game and its cultural impact on the world of entertainment today. </Overview>

Y'see, this version of The Match Game employed a staid but reliable format that earned the show a 7-season run and guaranteed host of The MATCH Game Gene Rayburn a permanent place in game show history. Debuting Monday December 31, 1962 on NBC-TV "In Living Color." The Match Game pitted 2 teams of 3 players each (two contestants each paired with a celebrity, for a total of 6 contestants). Rayburn posed a simple question (e.g., "Name a green vegetable" or "To a rich man, *blank* dollars is nothing."). Each team member without consulting the others writes his/her response on an index card with a crayon. Rayburn then calls for each player's answer, one at a time. The teams earn points for each correct answer as thus: * Two</Overview>

The connection between them was Howard Publications, a Los Angeles based publishing empire that had been built up from scratch by its dynamic owner, Glenn Howard. Howard's position of power, his confrontations with business and political enemies, and his own flamboyant lifestyle were portrayed in his portion of The Name of the Game. Within the Howard empire were investigative correspondent Jeff Dillon and editor Dan Farrell. Dillon was a super-agressive former newsboy who had clawed his way up to a position of power and respect working for Howard's People Magazine. Farrell was a former FBI agent who had gone into the publishing business because it provided a position from which to make the public aware of the threats posed by organized crime.</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Adventure Game</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/80562-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Little marvel that brightened up many teatime, often thought of as the forerunner of The Crystal Maze.

Three rent-a-celeb types were guided around a series of mental and physical puzzles devised by Patrick Dowling. The puzzles usually involved logical thinking with some lateral twists.

The show had quite a cute backplot. Set on the planet Arg, the inhabitants (sometimes human, sometimes dragon shape-changers called "the Argonds") put the contestants through their paces, including:

Dorgan, the friendly helpful one that got the contestants under way.

Gandor the Butler, who used an ear trumpet to help him see, and wore his glasses to help him hear.

Dagnor, the backwards-talking Australian who would compliment contestants with a "Doogy Rev" if they'd done well.

Rangdo, the shy ruler of the planet that took the physical prescience of an Aspidistra (or, later, a teapot).

Also of note is The Red Salamander, a mute but very tall lizard who often played against the contestants in the Drogna game when competing for prizes such as green cheese rolls (see later). 

Anagrams-R-Us

As you may have noticed by now, nearly everything to do with the game was an anagram of "dragon", including the obligatory salute "Gronda, Gronda". The currency on the planet was the Drogna, which were clear plastic pieces containing a coloured shape in the middle. The value of the drogna was equal to the number of sides on the shape, multiplied by their position in the rainbow (hence a sign saying Richard of York Gained Battle on the wall).

The Drogna Game

One of the initial challenges, the "drogna game", was a floor-tile puzzle that made use of these shapes. A particular logic applied to where you could or couldn't move (e.g. you can only move to a square with the same shape or colour).

One of the sub-games involved the contestants finding Lesley Judd, who would turn out to be The Mole and attempt to sabotage subsequent challenges.

Other games were wide and varied, but included stepping through a series of poles, guiding a mouse around a computer maze, interacting with the Argonds and their strange quirks, defeating the Red Salamander at the Drogna game, guiding a fellow player out of a pitch-black room, gentle physics problems, and solving codes.

Although the challenges in each programme were all variations-on-a-theme throughout the series, the final round in later shows was always the superb Vortex game, where the contestants had to cross a hexagonal lattice.

They had to move without stepping on the same space as the vortex, which would "evaporate" them. The contestant and the vortex (which was invisible to the contestants but visible to the viewers) would take one turn each move.

Only by logic, guesswork, and the occasional use of green cheese rolls (which could be used to identify where the vortex was) could the team get across safely to the waiting shuttle. Otherwise they had to walk home, and it's a long way from Arg to Earth. Nail-biting stuff.

One other feature worth mentioning is the "phone links" in later series where one of the hosts would ask children at home what they should do. Didn't really add much to the game, truth be told.

Key moments

Much celebration when a contestant managed to get across the Vortex grid, even though it meant Rangdo (the Aspidistra) got very angry indeed.

Catchphrases
