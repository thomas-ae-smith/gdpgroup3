<Overview>Leave It to Beaver is a 1950s and 1960s family-oriented American television situation comedy about an inquisitive but often naive boy named Theodore "Beaver" Cleaver and his adventures at home, in school, and around his suburban neighborhood. The show has attained an iconic status in the United States, with the Cleavers exemplifying the idealized suburban family of the mid-twentieth century.
One of the first primetime sitcom series filmed from a child's point-of-view, the show was created by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, two radio and early television writers, who found inspiration for the show's characters, plots, and dialogue in the lives, experiences, and conversations of their own children. Like several television dramas and sitcoms of the late fifties and early sixties (Lassie and My Three Sons, for example), Leave It to Beaver is a glimpse at middle-class, American boyhood. A typical episode features Beaver getting into some sort of trouble and facing his parents for reprimand and correction.</Overview>

<Overview>The New Leave It to Beaver was a sequel to the 1950s sitcom, Leave it to Beaver. The premise had Wally Cleaver and younger brother, Theodore "Beaver" Cleaver all grown up, with families of their own. Theodore is divorced, but his sons, Kip and Oliver live with him and they all live with his widow mom, June Cleaver in the suburbs. Wally lives next door with his wife and daughter Kelly and, later, son Kevin joins the brood. Eddie Haskell is still around, and he has a family as well, but Eddie will always be Eddie, and his two sons are no different.  The New Leave It To Beaver began with the 1983 CBS film Still The Beaver, and was picked up in 1985 as a Disney Channel series with the same name. But it only lasted one season and was then picked up by TBS in 1986 and renamed  The New Leave It To Beaver. The series lasted until 1989 and 103-108 episodes were made. Broadcast History
