  <Overview>Broadcast live, in front of an audience of comedy enthusiasts of mixed political persuasion. The hosts will respond to news and up-to-the minute results interacting with the studio audience, and giving their inimitable take on the election as it unfolds.

The show promises satire and sass, minus the staid political swing-o-meters. As the main results pour in, pundits and an in-studio bookmaker analyse the facts with no-nonsense, non-partisan predictions.

Together with the live studio action there are some specially recorded shows, played out in segments throughout the night, including You Have Been Watching Election Special with Robert Webb; calls from the Fonejacker (Kayvan Novak), plus a Come Dine with Me Election Special, featuring Edwina Currie, Brian Paddick, Derek Hatton and Rod Liddle.

The evening will provide spiky and intelligent coverage of the results, once the polls have closed, and the gloves are off.</Overview>
