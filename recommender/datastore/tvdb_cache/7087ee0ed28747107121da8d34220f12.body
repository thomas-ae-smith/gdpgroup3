  <Overview>Arthur Read, the spectacular bespectacled aardvark stars in this children's series about growing up. Typical childhood problems such as bratty siblings, schoolyard bullies and classroom cliques are addressed by this popular program which recently completed its ninth season on PBS. Developed from Marc Brown's beloved books, Arthur reminds us all of how it feels to be 8 years old. Just like your average kid, Arthur overcomes the dreaded obstacles of third-grade life, such as his tough teacher Mr. Ratburn, bullies, and mountains of homework. At home, Arthur must face the pint-sized terror also known as his sister Dora Winifred, or D.W. for short. Everything between these two is a struggle; who gets control of the television remote, who can play their Crazy Bus CD, whose hobbies are dumber, that's a baby show...Will Arthur ever win one of these pointless arguments? Prob'ly never, because not only is D.W. fiercely independent, she's also very smart. But despite it all, Arthur and D.W.</Overview>

Mr. Ratburn gives the class an assignment --- to write a story about anything they want. It seems like a simple assignment and it doesn't even have to be bound and sent to a publisher as Muffy suggests. Arthur, however, finds it a hard task when he starts trying to write to please everyone's tastes. He starts out with the simple story of how he got his dog Pal, but after following the advice of each of his friends, it morphs into a bizarre country tune about baby elephants being born in outer space.

Buster makes Mike sound plenty cool, but Arthur really needs Buster's help with their science project.

Arthur begins wonder if Buster isn't his friend anymore.

  <Overview>#11501   &quot;&quot;Arthur's Family Vacation&quot;&quot;
Arthur will do anything to get out of going on a family vacation and go to camp, until the prospect of one-upping D.W. convinces him to give it a shot. Everyone has all sorts of exciting dream plans --- Dad's lobster dinner, fun at the beach and an exciting stay at the hotel's Family Fun Suite. From the beginning, though, things go wrong, with the plans plagued by storms, traffic, unplanned pit stops and other assorted hassles. By the time everyone's in the hotel, they're thoroughly soured on the idea of vacation. Arthur, though, comes up with an idea that may just save their plans for a fun trip.

  <Overview>#11701   &quot;&quot;Meek for a Week&quot;&quot;
Everyone knows that Francine is rather bossy and somewhat independent, but when she insults Muffy on her street hockey playing skills, it would seem she's gone to far. After a bit of crying, Muffy decides to make a bet with Francine --- she'll give Francine the Princess Peach watch that she's always adored if Francine can be nice for an entire week. Francine takes the bet seriously and pretty soon, her behavior is barely recognizable to her friends. Worried that she may be bottling her anger, Arthur and the rest of the group try to get Francine to let off some steam, before she ends up doing something really rash.

D.W. and Nadine put it to the test by having the neighborhood kid Vecita say it to her parents.

  <Overview>#90301   &quot;&quot;Arthur Weighs In&quot;&quot;
Having landed a role for a class play, Arthur finds that he can't fit into his outfit. It would seem that he's become a bit, well, &quot;&quot;husky.&quot;&quot; There's no way, though, that he's going to wear an ugly-looking husky suit. He and his friends team up to get him in shape, but it seems some non-peer advice might hold the key to the real solution.
#90302   &quot;&quot;The Law of the Jungle Gym&quot;&quot;
The Tough Customers --- most of the kids in Arthur's class fear them, even though they're definitely not the most fierce as far as bullies go. However, when Muffy tries using the jungle gym they use as their Tower of Pain for a photo shoot, she starts a feud that has everyone in Ratburn's class on her side. Muffy, however, doesn't care about freeing the jungle gym, she just wants a good space for her photo shooting. And Molly doesn't really want to terrorize Muffy, she just wants her old place to chill back.

  <Overview>&quot;&quot;Binky Goes Nuts&quot;&quot;   When Binky discovers that he's allergic to peanuts, he has so many questions: Will he be forced to live without Chinese food? Will he ever again be able to eat with his friends? And most importantly, will his Mom ever calm down? Binky learns that the best way not to go nuts is to be well informed and to understand his allergy.
&quot;&quot;Breezy Listening Blues&quot;&quot;   Much to his horror, Brain gets a &quot;&quot;B-&quot;&quot; on a test. That's only one grade above a C! What caused this disaster? Could it be the new &quot;&quot;Breezy Listening&quot;&quot; background music playing at the Ice Cream Shop? Brain is determined to get to the bottom of this before he loses what's left of his IQ.

Arthur and Buster are disappointed to have homework on the weekend of the big Bionic Bunny / Dark Bunny special (in which everything will be revealed), but vow to complete it before the start of the special. Arthur, however, struggles with the assignment. Mr. and Mrs. Read are celebrating their tenth anniversary at a fancy restaurant. They're dropping Arthur off for Buster's sleepover and D.W. at Grandma Thora's. But car troubles leave everyone stranded. Things seemingly go from bad to worse when Arthur and D.W. get locked in a storage room in an old diner. They're disappointed, and a bit scared, but find inspiration in an old radio drama called &quot;Kid Carter and his Sidekick Mistral.&quot;</Overview>

Binky, however, is still worried about failure, but learns that it's important to have fun and the only person you're ever really competing against is yourself.
