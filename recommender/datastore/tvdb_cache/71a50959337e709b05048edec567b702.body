<Overview>"Tony Danza (Who's the Boss?) returns to television as a divorced sportswriter raising two teenaged daughters in this charming comedy."  "Tony DiMeo (Tony Danza) misses the old days. The days when he could bang out his sports column on a noisy typewriter. The days when athletes were role models, not millionaires. The days when kids always listened to their parents. Well, two out of three. These days, Tony has an assistant, computer- whiz Carmen, to get his column e-mailed successfully to his editor. And sports - well, it seems no one cares about the game anymore. Plus, Tony's raising moody Tina (16) and hypochondriac Mickey (13) on his own since his wife took the "job of a lifetime" and moved out of state. It's a challenging life, to say the least."  "More often than not, Tony's overwhelmed by all the women in his life - it's hard to be a man's man when he's surrounded by estrogen. But despite Tina's tantrums, Mickey's illnesses, and Tony's frequent technological breakdowns,</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Lenny Henry Show (1984)</SeriesName>
<Overview>"Katanga my friends!" This is the first of Lenny Henry's stand-up/sketch shows which had a similar format to the present (2004) version. In each show Lenny would stand in front of an audience telling jokes about his past life, joking about the antics of his part Birmingham, part Jamaica upbringing. He also touched on topical events in amusing ways. Many sketches were featured featuring recurring Henry characters, including the first appearances of the soul-singing sex-god Theophilus P Wildebeeste, PC Ganga, dear old Deakus, one of the first batch of post-war Jamaican immigrants who "came to h-England in um...in um in a boat!" and Derek The Teacher, a lampoon of the sort of student-teachers torn to shreds by inner-city schoolkids. Lenny also impersonated celebs including Prince, Michael Jackson and the one and only David Bellemy... "Gwapple me gwapenuts!". One key feature which has also made a sporadic appearance in more recent series of Lenny Henry's shows, were parodies</Overview>

<SeriesName>SuperFriends: The Legendary Super Powers Show</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/70913-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Super Friends returned to ABC on Saturday September 8, 1984 with a new thirty minute program that typically featured two 11-minute stories per episode. This incarnation featured Superman, Batman, Robin and Wonder Woman, and also the Wonder Twins and Gleek, this time teamed up with Firestorm. In addition to this core group, episodes during this season also featured some cameos by old and new Super Friends. The program lasted one season until August 31, 1985. The appeal of this version of the series at the time were the emphasis on actual villains from the comic books. Brainiac, Lex Luthor, Mirror Master, Mr Mxyzptlk, as well as Darkseid and his henchmen from Apokolips, all made appearances. Mirror Master only used pocket mirrors and larger mirrors to capture the Super Friends. He didn't use any ray guns or mirror traveling. Darkseid and his underlings were actually introduced into animated form in this series. One of the oddities of the show's opening credits is the depiction of Brainiac as he appeared in the 1970s and early 1980s even though on the episodes of this series, Brainiac's appearance was in line with the comic book's of that time period — being depicted in a more skeletal form. Another oddity was having Aquaman appear in the opening sequence but he never made an appearance throughout this run of the series.

This season, and the one to follow, featured the “Super Powers” tag which was part of a marketing tie-in with a toyline of the same name produced by Kenner</Overview>

Many of the key players are interviewed: Simon Cowell, Ant and Dec, Susan Boyle, Gary Barlow, Piers Morgan, Tony Hatch, Dermot O'Leary, Nina Myskow, Nigel Lythgoe, Amanda Holden, Lenny Henry, Alexandra Burke, Dannii Minogue, Gareth Gates, Louis Walsh, JLS, Kelly Rowland, and One Direction.

<Overview>The nine series of 50 minute programmes produced between 1968 and 1976 by Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise are generally considered to be their best output; all penned by Eddie Braben (save for the 1976 Christmas Show which was penned by John Junkin and Barry Cryer) these programmes used a familiar format of opening spot with the duo in front of their familiar "tabs", followed by a musical guest, sketches, another musical guest followed by a scene in the fictional flat, either in bed or in the lounge greeting star guests, usually a play "What Ern Wrote" and the closing song and credits. This format was occasionally not used but was considered the "norm" during the pair's BBC years. Until 1973, unlike other shows episodes were broadcast every fortnight rather than weekly.</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beechnut Show</SeriesName>
<Overview>The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beechnut Show was Dick Clark's second attempt at a prime time show. His first, a prime-time version of American Bandstand, ran only 13 weeks. The Beechnut Show was much more successful lasting almost 3 years.  The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beechnut Show was broadcast live Saturday nights from the Little Theatre in New York City. Every weekend, Dick Clark commuted from Philadelphia to NYC to do the "Beechnut" show. There was actually two shows done each Saturday. The first was a rehearsal show where the artists could sketch out their performances and Clark could line everything up. This would have a different audience then the second show which was the one that was televised.  Beechnut Gum was actually picked up as a sponser for the third episode to the conclusion of the show's run. The artists that appeared usually "lip-synched" to their records. Very few actually performed live. This is the only show to be able to make the claim of having B</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Real Roseanne Show</SeriesName>
<Overview>The Real Roseanne Show  was comedian Roseanne's latest attempt to return to television. The reality series was supposed to chronicle her creation of the ABC Family show "Domestic Goddess", but the day before The Real Roseanne Show premiered, Domestic Goddess was canceled. The threat of further delays due to Roseanne's planned hysterectomy probably played a part in the decision.  The Real Roseanne Show premiered to low ratings and was consequently canceled after only two weeks.ABC Broadcast History: First Telecast: August 6, 2003 Last Telecast: August 13, 2003 Episodes: 4 Color Episodes &amp;lt;p ALIGN=CENTER&amp;gt;

<SeriesName>The Mysti Show</SeriesName>
<Overview>The Mysti Show is about a half human half fairy who lives with a lot of other fairies on the heath after magicing herself a TV Show. The Mysti Show was first aired in April 2004 in a bid to win viewers onto the BBC. It was a very girly orientated show and was aimed at teenagers (or so they said) but the presenters and the storyline was a bit childish. Girls around the age of 6/7 watched Mysti. So the idea flopped and viwers began to carry on watching Ministry of Mayhem aka M.O.M. So in September, Mysti was axed and never to return after only 4 months. Lets face it it was pathetic. So now on the CBBC Channel at 1:30 you can see the Mysti Story part of Mysti Show.</Overview>

<Overview>Welcome to The Ray Stevens Show Guide at TV Tome. This variety series occurred during the summer of 1970 as a replacement for "The Andy Williams Show," which was canceled in 1971. One of the regular performers, "Mama" Cass Elliot, was a very successful singer who made many TV appearances from the 1960s until her untimely death in 1974. The United States First Telecast: June 20th, 1970 Last Telecast: August 8th, 1970 These episodes aired on Fridays at 7:30PM This show was basically full of different sketches and musical performances by the cast. It was taped in Canada and aired in the US on NBC and in the UK on BBC. The show was originally a Canadian sketch series. But the series is perhaps most interesting in hindsight, affording an early view of the movie comedy superstar-to-be Steve Martin. The show produced 8 episodes, each about an hour long. It's a shame that the show only ran for the summer. Canada First Telecast: Unknown</Overview>

But we never got to find out who Bonnie ended up with because the show was cancelled after 11 episodes. Bonnie's character is much the same as The Building. Very wholesome and kind. Often to a fault.

<SeriesName>The Porter Wagoner Show</SeriesName>
<Overview>By the mid-1950s,  the novelty medium of television was the obvious tool for product marketers to reach a wider audience than ever before.  All kinds of advertisers were keen to sponsor shows to promote their wares to the vast new audiences. The Chattanooga Medicine Company had been keeping southerners regular with Black Draught laxative and women's troubles forgotten with the 20% alcohol formula of Wine of Cardui for many years.  However they saw an opportunity to increase their sales through television using the down-home appeal of country music. Red Foley's Ozark Jubliee was already successfully broadcasting,  and Tex Ritter's Ranch Party had had a successful run,  and there was ample room on the airwaves for yet another showcase of country music talent,  and so auditions were held for the new  Chattanooga Medicine Co. vehicle.  One of the hopefuls was Porter Wagoner - others included Webb Pierce,  Carl Smith and the Wilburn Brothers,  who eventually got their own show.</Overview>
