<SeriesName>Airport 24/7: Miami</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/262588-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The inner workings of a large U.S. airport, especially considering increased security measures implemented post-9/11, are prime fodder for a reality series. This Travel Channel entry presents an around-the-clock pass to one of the country's largest airports, Miami International. Its staff is charged with getting approximately 100,000 passengers through the airport safely each day, a stressful task because MIA is a prime target for terrorist threats. It is also a frequent point of entry for illegal drugs, and viewers see the ways in which smugglers attempt to disguise containers. The series concentrates on the work done by a cross-section of airport employees, among them security director Lauren Stover, operations agent Heidi Anthony and police officer Chris Rutledge.</Overview>
