<SeriesName>The Unforgettable Jeremy Beadle</SeriesName>
<Overview>There is no doubt that Jeremy James Anthony Gibson Beadle had the most remarkably fractured relationship with audiences throughout his career, from his early days as a DJ, journalist and concert promoter to his successful tv shows. When Game for a Laugh was at its height, 18 million people watched. Yet his prankster image made him an easy target for the press. However, his friends, colleagues and family talk about him as if he were a saint. And a very erudite one at that. Presumably the critics who vilified him for his "cruel" on-screen persona chose to ignore the fact that he raised an incredible 100 million pounds for charity during his lifetime. Friends and family tell of the presenter's private passions, and celebrity colleagues Chris Tarrant and Matthew Kelly also pay tribute to Jeremy, who died in 2008 at the age of 59.</Overview>
