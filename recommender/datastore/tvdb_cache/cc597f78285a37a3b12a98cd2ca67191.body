  <Overview>Written and created by Sally Wainwright and produced by Red Production Company, compelling three-part drama Unforgiven is the story of Ruth Slater (Suranne Jones), a woman released from prison on license after serving 15 years for the murder of two policemen.

Ruth has spent half of her life imprisoned, and now faces the daunting prospect of rebuilding her life whilst being irresistibly drawn to the place that haunts her, Upper Hanging Stones Farm. In spite of trying to focus on the future and her new boyfriend Brad (Will Mellor), Ruth is unable to forget her past and the sister, Katie, who she was forced to leave behind.

Outraged to hear that the woman who killed their father has been released, Kieran (Jack Deam) and Steve Whelan (Matthew McNulty) are eager to seek revenge.  Believing that life should mean life, the two brothers decide to take the law into their own hands. But just how far are they capable of going? Can they really do to her what she did to their father?

As the details about Ruthâ€™s past become known, maintaining a job, friendship and a relationship become increasingly arduous. Ruth soon realises that the ramifications of her release spread further than she could have imagined, with far reaching implications for everyone involved.</Overview>

  <Overview>Sally Wainwright's gripping, touching thriller ends as we find out what really happened all those years ago in that grey farmhouse on the moors, when two police officers were murdered. Suranne Jones continues to be pitch-perfect as Ruth Slater - released from prison on licence after 15 years - who is searching for self-assurance and a place in a life that's never really been her own. Just watch her fearful, tentative mask crack when she finally hears news of her beloved sister Katie, who was adopted, renamed Lucy and is now studying music at university. 

Ruth, often baffled by the modern world, is painfully in need of friendship, which finally comes from an unlikely quarter when the son of one of her victims attempts to extract a dreadful revenge. This is popular drama at its best. More, please.</Overview>
