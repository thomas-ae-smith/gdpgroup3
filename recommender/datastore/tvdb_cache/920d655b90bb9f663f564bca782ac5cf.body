Endurance and skill are the key ingredients as contestants take on multiple challenges for vastly different audiences, with limited resources.

Contestants show off their personal style and quick wit throughout the competition, but a final mad dash to three separate venues around Manhattan and Brooklyn will determine which competitor will win the ultimate prize</Overview>
