  <Overview>A Mediterranean hotspot for over two million tourists a year, Ibiza was first claimed by the hippies and then taken over by the ravers. Phil has been holidaying there for years: first as a backpacker, and now as a family man, and he is a fully paid up member to the island's fan club. However for Kirstie the mere thought of Ibiza, the clubbing capital of the world, fills her with dread. Can Phil convince Kirstie that Ibiza rivals other gems of the Med for holiday escapism?

Kirstie is charged with the budget break and seeing if Ibiza can be a charming getaway for a family. She picks a campsite on the north east coast in Cala Nova, just 50 yards from one of the most beautiful beaches on the island, from under £5 a night in a tent to around £50 for a bunglaow. She may not have an inner hippy, but once off the beaten track and after some horse riding along the beach, Kirstie starts to see the appeal of Ibiza for chilled out family escapes.

In contrast, Phil finally gets to dip his toe in the exclusive luxury of the Ibiza super-rich as he checks out a private suite at one of the island's most exclusive hotels.

Kirstie is convinced that Ibiza is just expensive because the stars go there to party. But can a private pool, power boat trip to a remote beach with a champagne picnic, and an exquisite tasting menu back at the hotel prove to Kirstie that the Balearic island's glamorous reputation is worth the money?</Overview>

  <Overview>Will Kirstie and Phil fall for the rustic charm of the Tuscan hills, or the luxury of one of the most expensive hotels in Florence?

The Italian countryside attracts around 40 million tourists every year, and away from the packed-out coastal resorts there's a great big slice of rural Tuscan life to be discovered.

Phil is in charge of their budget Tuscan break with £500 per person to spend. He opts to go off the beaten track to an agriturismo farm called La Baccane in the heart of the countryside. It is run by a family, for families, and is the very definition of rustic - 11 hectares complete with vines, olive groves and an orchard.

They are there to live off the farm at a bargain rate of £25 per night per person. It may be simple but there are plenty of added extras - such as free bike hire, a swimming pool, and dinner comes with a free cookery </Overview>

  <Overview>Kirstie visits a budget eco-hotel high up in St Moritz, and Phil hang-glides off the side of a mountain.

St Moritz is one of the UK's favourite winter escapes. But the snow-capped playground for the rich and famous is not the most budget-friendly family resort. Kirstie tracks down an affordable holiday right in the heart of the season, including an amazing three miles of sledging and an all-you-can-eat fondue in an igloo.

Meanwhile Phil delivers up a luxury holiday including a personal ski guide and a room at the five-star Kempinski Grand Hotel right next door to the ski slopes.

Extreme-sports lover Phil also goes hang-gliding. But at £160 for a ten minute flight, is this expensive treat worth it</Overview>

  <Overview>Kirstie and Phil head to North Africa and the Moroccan city of Marrakech. From the spice of the souks to the charms of the old city, Marrakech has long been an exotic stop off for adventurous travellers.

Phil has visited Morocco before while backpacking, but for Kirstie it isn't a destination high on her wish list. Will it win her over? She is in charge of their budget stay for under £500 per person. She has selected a traditional, gorgeous Marrakech guest house called a Riad for their stay. Riad des Epices is right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the souks and rooms are from £41 per person per night.

Phil's `money's no object' break leads him to La Mamounia, a destination of pure indulgence, said to be described by Winston Churchill as the most lovely spot in the whole world. Offering an authentic Moroccan experience without having to leave the comfort of the hotel, with breathtaking views across the Atlas Mountains, the splendour of the suites are akin to any high end penthouse apartment.</Overview>
