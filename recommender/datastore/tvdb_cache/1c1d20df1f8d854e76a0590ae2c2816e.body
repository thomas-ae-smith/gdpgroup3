    <Overview>Welcome to the Sunshine guide at TV Tome. Widowed father Sam Hayden lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, and tries to make a living for himself and the five-yr-old daughter from his late wife's previous marriage. The town disapproves of Sam's free-wheeling ways, especially his singing. Neighbor Nora functions as a sort of surrogate mother for Jill. Based on a 1973 made-for-television movie of the same name. There is no editor for this show. If you would like to be the editor look here for details.</Overview>
