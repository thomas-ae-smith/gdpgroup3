  <Overview>The space family Robinson is sent on a five-year mission to find a new planet to colonize, but the voyage is sabotaged time and again by an inept stowaway, Dr. Zachary Smith. The family's spaceship, Jupiter II, also carries a friendly robot who endures an endless stream of abuse from Dr. Smith, but is a trusted companion of young Will Robinson (`Danger, Will Robinson' became the show's catchphrase). The sci-fi cult favorite was created by Irwin Allen, and inspired an uninspired 1998 movie. </Overview>

  <Overview>Professor Robinson discovers that the planets orbit will bring immense heat on the spaceship. With that knowledge the Robinson's take off in the chariot and head south.  However back at the Jupiter two, Dr Smith who stayed behind because he believed them to be lying, realises that the orbit is strange, bringing immense cold followed by extreme heat. He sends the Robot to tell them, and they then attempt to travel back to the Jupiter 2.  However in their way is a huge in-land sea which previously had been frozen solid.  The immense heat and cold make the vegetation charred.  They survive the heat and return to the Jupiter Two where they are most safe.</Overview>

  <Overview>The women of Lost in Space are featured in their very own episode while the boys are out installing communications equipment.  Smith is left in charge (boy is that a mistake) and he &quot;cleans&quot; their weapons, but cannot remember how to rebuild the weapons.  This leaves the J2 crew defenseless.
A creepy creature stalks the Robinson women however they think a small dog is to blame for raids on food and other mischief.</Overview>

  <Overview>Lost in Space's only Christmas program.  Will uses an alien transporter to send himself back to earth. However, many people believe the Robinson family to be dead after hearing the ship went off course.  Nobody on Earth believes him, and they lock him up with the intention of sending him to a boys' home.
Will escapes the family home he's in, and wanders around these clueless bunch of townspeople, but finds carbon tetrachoride - needed for the food processors on the Jupiter. Eventually he convinces another boy Davey to let him out, and let him return to the planet he came from. He returns to Priplanis with this bottle.  Of course no one believes his adventures until he produces the bottle, plainly labeled as coming from earth.</Overview>

He extracts a promise from Don and John that they'll return to Earth, or else he'll destroy his navigation data.

When Dr Smith is removed from the camp, he is taken by two midgets who work with Raddion, and in another atempt to be returned to Earth, agrees to get the emotions from the Robinsons.  He does so by taking their pictures, and all that is needed is for the Robinsons to shake hands with him.  Don protests and heads back for camp, as do the Robinsons minus their emotions.  Eventually they are returned to normal and it is learnt that human emotions cannot be bought or stolen.</Overview>

  <Overview>The primitive beings are actually wards of a computer, Protinius, which can confer temporary advanced sentience on the leading man in order to communicate Protinius' will.
The episode also features a temporary camaraderie between Don and Smith, a burying of the hatchet, when Don is rescued by Smith from a pit, and then says &quot;&quot;Doctor Smith&quot;&quot; - using the word Doctor for the first time unknown ages.  However, their camaraderie dissolves and the characters are back to &quot;&quot;normal&quot;&quot;.  Not the first time Smith has become selfless and a man of some integrity, but as usual, Smith returns to normal.</Overview>

This &quot;&quot;Time Merchant&quot;&quot; takes Will, Professor Robinson, Smith, and the Robot, to his secret lair.  From there, Smith uses the Time Merchant's time machine to return himself to Earth on the day the Robinson's departed, with the objective of NOT sabotaging the Jupiter II mission and letting the Robinsons go on their way to Alpha Centauri.  The Time Merchant then announces that if Smith does not get on the Jupiter II, the ship will not fly off course and will therefore be destroyed by a collision with an asteroid several months after liftoff.  So Will is sent back to join Smith and try to convince him to get on the Jupiter II as he originally did.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Robot suddenly announces that the Jupiter II is approaching Alpha Centauri.  Everyone is suprised, and the ship lands on a planet, where they are greeted by a group of people who appear to be teenagers from Earth.  It turns out that they are aliens who live like Earth-style hippies, and they are incapable of growing old.  They want to age normally, and to do this they want to get the older members of the Robinson party to leave in the Jupiter II while the younger members can stay behind and be used in an experiment that will make it possible for them to do so.  The aliens trick the older members of the Robinson party into leaving, but Will pulls a fast one on the aliens and the Jupiter II eventually returns to the planet, and Penny, Will, and Dr. Smith, who somehow passed himself off as a young person, are rescued.</Overview>

  <Overview>Doctor Smith uses the Space Pod to land on a planet that the Jupiter II is passing by.  It turns out that the planet has evolved in such a way that plants are the highest form of life, and some of them are quite intelligent.  One of these plants, a large carrot, captures Smith and tries to change him into a plant.  The Jupiter II lands and the Robinsons and West come to Smith's rescue, only to be captured themselves.  Eventually they thwart the plant creature and make their escape.</Overview>
