    <Overview>Hosted by Rich Eisen (NFL Total Access), The Great Escape drops teams of ordinary people into the middle of their own epic action/adventure movie. Each week, three pairs of players will compete for a cash prize by escaping from such locations as a seven-story castle, a deserted island, a sinking ship or a maximum security prison. Players must use their wits, skills and whatever tools they can find to overcome obstacles, evade pursuers and make their way to freedom.</Overview>
