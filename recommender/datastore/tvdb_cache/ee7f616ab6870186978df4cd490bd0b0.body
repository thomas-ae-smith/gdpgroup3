<Overview>This is a pretty good expose on the history of the Mafia. I am nowhere near an expert in such things, but this set interested me as I have read the occasional Mafia novel, and this set was just so dang cheap. </Overview>

<SeriesName>The Mafia Empire</SeriesName>
<Overview>Mafia Empire is a comprehensive investigation into the history of greed, treachery and violence of organized crime in America. The three-part documentary traces the origins of the five major crime families from their beginnings in Italy through today. The account includes shocking, first-hand testimony from former Mafioso, historians and government agents. Beginning with bootlegging during the 1920s, the Mafia quickly developed a stronghold into other sectors: organized labor, entertainment, gambling and narcotics. However, their activities virtually went unchecked by J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI. It is widely believed that Hoover feared being exposed by the mob due to his alleged homosexuality. Thus, crime continued to run rampant and at its height, the Mafia’s influence spread throughout the country. While the FBI’s success in prosecuting prominent family members may have weakened the old guard, a new wave of organized crime continues behind-the-scenes. The series also explores current wars being waged in global organized crime and looks at the new Mafia.</Overview>
