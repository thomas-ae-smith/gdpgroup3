  <Overview>Mapperson's Daughter

Mapperson's Bakery is running a contest to find a new 'face' for the Mapperson's Bakery Delivery Truck. Angela is sure she is a shoe in until Johnny announces it to the entire school and soon everyone is vying for the title. Everyone except Gina Lash who believes it is the product that makes Mapperson's so special not all of the commercialism. Nanette is also in the running with her professionally done photographs and of course she and Angela spend their time trying to sabotage the others' efforts. The big day arrives and Mr. Mapperson makes the announcement. The new face for the truck is ... Gina Lash! Mr. Mapperson explains that Gina is his biggest customer and therefore a natural choice to represent Mapperson's Bakery.

Big Ho Down

Angela is totally embarrassed that her Dad, Bill is making her dance with him in the annual Father-Daughter Ho-Down. Even worse he is taking her shopping for Western Duds! At Spangley Jangles Western Shop they run in to Nanette and her Father, Howell, who have won the Father-Daughter Ho-Down for the last two years. Howell makes some snide remarks about the Anacondas and Angela's ability to dance which infuriate Bill who then challenges Howell to a Ho-Down Show-Down! Both teams practice every waking hour before the big night but in the end Howell's many bribes pay off and the Manoirs win the Ho-Down for the third year in a row. Too bad for the Manoirs Bill has played a trick of his own which involves his two-way-super-sticky-tape and the insides of the Manoirs cowboy hats!

  <Overview>Rough Times Tables 
 
Angela's class is working on their multiplication tables and for once Angela is having no problems because Gina Lash - smartest in class has been helping her study. But to everyone's surprise, and Angela's delight, Nanette is having all kinds of problems with multiplication. Angela decides that she is now good enough to start playing and stop studying. Gina warns her that repetition is the key to memorization but Angela is convinced that she has it all in her head. Nanette now enlists Gina as her tutor for the price of as many free cinnamon swirls as Gina can eat. Nanette passes the big test with flying colors whereas Angela doesn't even answer a question. Angela is sentenced to three weeks of math during recess but her ever faithful pal Gina volunteers to take the punishment with her and act as her personal tutor for every recess. 
 
Works of Art 
 
Mrs. Brinks poses as the model during Art Class. Nanette of course draws a picture of a beautiful woman barely resembling Mrs. Brinks whereas Angela tries to capture the &quot;true woman&quot;. When Mrs. Brinks sees Angela's drawing she is appalled and insists that Angela fix it at once. Nanette chides that perhaps Angela doesn't have the artistic ability. All of Angela's friends think her picture is great and as a joke Angela doctors the picture to be an even more hideous representation of their teacher and the kids think this is hilarious. On the way home from school the kids want to see the picture again but when Angela tries to find it in her bag it is missing. She left it on her desk instead of her test paper! Angela and the gang sneak back into the school to get the picture before Mrs. Brinks see it.</Overview>

  <Overview>Everybody Loves Gina 
 
Angela and Gina plan for a fabulous sleepover. Devious delights are happily agreed upon until Angela's brothers remind her just how obnoxious they truly are. Angela considers calling the whole thing off when Liz Lash and her new boy toy, Francisco, promptly drop Gina off at the Anaconda's. Gina immediately charms Mark and Derek with a peace offering of sorts. Soon, the whole Anaconda family is under Gina's spell as she appears to be funnier, more polite and simply nicer than Angela could ever be. Angela is jealous! Things only get worse when Gina extends her sleepover at the Anaconda residence for another two weeks. When a carnival is thrown to celebrate Gina's extended stay, Angela tries to get mad but is unable to sustain any ill will towards her best friend. Eventually, Gina gets bored of Angela's family and the carnival. The two friends find their way back into each other's hearts and partake in the cheeky fun they had planned in the beginning. 
 
Halls of Justice 
 
Distracted by an orange sash and delusions of grandeur, Angela volunteers for the prestigious position of school hall monitor-without knowing the positions drawbacks. She must miss all recesses and soon, Angela is forced to croak out orders to fellow classmates. Angela's new life seems doomed until she catches Nanette littering. Angela immediately gives Nanette a violation ticket and becomes a heroine amongst her friends. Nanette vows revenge and Angela is forced into snitching on everyone and assigning them all tickets. Eventually, everyone despises Angela and her snitching ways - except Mrs. Brinks! She is so impressed with Angela that she leaves her in charge of the class for one day. Desperate to get fired from her new position and regain her good name, Angela allows the class to misbehave and is quickly let go. Meanwhile, Nanette is given the position of hall monitor, and all the disadvantages that go along with it!</Overview>

  <Overview>Cabin Fever 
 
Angela decides that she has had enough of clapping erasers and she yearns to never return to school again. Enter Mrs. Praline, Josephine's mother, who has agoraphobia, which means she never leaves her house. Angela decides that agoraphobia is the answer to all her problems and instantly diagnoses herself with the ailment. Bill and Geneva are quite concerned with their daughter's predicament and battle the agoraphobic symptoms head on. Not only is Angela kept home from school, she is also kept indoors, away from her friends...forever! Angela is forced to find amusement with Lulu and worse yet, her brothers. Yet none of the Anaconda's can find time for Angela and she must entertain herself. Faced with eternal boredom, Angela admits that she faked the agoraphobia, and returns to school, which by now couldn't please her more! 
 
Don't Over-Due It 
 
It's library amnesty day at Tapwater Elementary School. In order to avoid expensive fines, everyone returns their overdue books. Angela is proud of the fact that she always returns books on time...or so she thinks! While reading her favourite &quot;Happy Hoppy Bunny&quot; book, Angela realizes the book is library property and she has had it since kindergarten. By now, amnesty day is over and huge library fines loom in Angela's future. Angela enlists the aid of her friends to find ways to avoid the fines. They try many forms of trickery that all end in failure. Nanette quickly catches on to Angela's dilemma and tattles on her. Angela concludes that the only solution is to hide the evidence. Only she finds that she can't hide from the truth. She is caught clutching her copy of &quot;Happy Hoppy Bunny&quot;, which, her mother points out, was bought and paid for at a library book sale! Angela was right all along. She never had an overdue library book and Nanette is punished for suggesting otherwise.</Overview>

  <Overview>Kar-Lean On Me 
 
Angela begins the school day by having her newest cereal toy confiscated by Mrs. Brinks. The day seems to be like any other typical school day. That is until Karlene reveals that she and Nanette had a falling out over a less than fashionable fur hat. Karlene turns to Angela and pals for solace. Angela is hesitant to offer Karlene comfort but eventually warms up to her charms. Soon Karlene appears to be less like Nanette, and more like Angela. Angela is so sure Karlene has changed, she shares her secrets. Angela's theory is quickly disproved as Karlene betrays Angela's confidence to none other then Nanette Manior. Backstabbing and fashion reunite Karlene and Nanette while Angela is left with nothing but the fake fur hat on her head. Despite all that has happened, Angela gets the last laugh and teaches Karlene a thing or two about friendship and economics. 
 
Slice of Life 
 
Upon hearing an annoying, but rather catchy jingle for the county fair, Johnny's Uncle Nicky decides to shoot a commercial for Abatti's Pizza. Angela and Gina are convinced they are shoe-ins, and go to great lengths to secure their roles. They even go as far as hiring the always dramatic Gordy as their acting coach, who deprives them of pizza in order to get a convincing performance. Hearing the news, nasty Nanette Manior steals their spotlight (literally) bumping Angela and Gina out of the lead. Unfortunately, Uncle Nicky takes a liking to Nanette and her star qualities, but it is Nonna who decides the final edit. Angela and Gina arrive at the premiere destined for disappointment, until they see that Nanette has been cut from the commercial, and replaced by none other than Angela, Gina and Nonna herself!</Overview>

  <Overview>The Nanette Lock 
 
While playing on the swing set in the schoolyard, Angela invents a cool new way to swing! She locks arms and legs with Gina and they swing together in rhythm. Nanette walks through the playground just as they are demonstrating this new swinging innovation, and decides to take credit for the technique by naming it the &quot;Nanette Lock&quot;. Angela is determined to set the record straight by proving to everyone that the invention was hers to begin with, but her only witnesses are discredited by none other than nannoying Nanette Manior. Quick to praise her stellar 'inventor' student, Mrs. Brinks rushes to the playground to attempt the &quot;Nanette Lock&quot; herself, but the weight of her- ample figure causes the swing to detach from the swing set and sends Mrs. Brinks plummeting to the ground! Seeing the fire in Brinks' eyes, Nanette blurts out the truth about the swinging invention. Angela is so happy to finally receive the credit she deserves, she doesn't even mind clapping erasers! 
 
Gordy Floats 
 
It is spring, and Gordy can't wait to win first prize in the 'Spring into Spring' float making competition like he has every year. But this year, Nanette is entering with a float made from a real live fire truck and it's filled with French roses imported from France. Angela, Gina and Johnny agree to band together to defeat Nanette in her ploy to be the first to overtake the reining 'Spring into Spring' champion. Although their intentions were good, Gordy's float turns out to be a gondola full of garbage and old tube socks, and Angela feels she is the one to blame. Just as the judges are about to award Nanette first prize, Gordy shows up with a red wagon carrying a solitary red rose bud in a vase. The judges erupt with compliments and decide that the simplicity and sheer beauty of Gordy's float is worthy of first prize!</Overview>

  <Overview>Vicious Cycle 
 
An annual bike race is an event that could easily bring a smile to Angela's face. However, Angela is stuck with hand-me-down bikes from her goofy brothers while Nanette rides the best bikes that money can buy. Angela is doomed to another humiliating defeat. That is until Angela finds a wallet stuffed with two hundred dollars. Of course, Angela would normally turn in a lost wallet but two hundred is a magical number. Two hundred is the prize money for winning the race and two hundred is the cost of a new bike. The logical choice is, buy a new bike and win the prize money, then replace the wallet money with said prize. Angela hides the wallet until she can put her plan into action. In the mean time, Angela's father, Bill, has refurbished Angela's old bike. He would have bought her a new one except he lost his wallet...filled with two hundred dollars! Angela realizes it was Bill's wallet she found only it's too late. She herself has lost it. Now Angela has no choice but to win the bike race in order to replace her father's money. 
 
To Catch a Thief 
 
Someone is robbing the Manoir Manor of their precious trinkets. Tapwater Springs jumps into action, immediately calling for the formation of a neighbourhood watch. A leader is needed to head the initiative and Angela happily volunteers her father Bill, who chooses Angela as his partner in crime fighting. Angela sees this as a chance to establish herself as the town's greatest crime fighter. The only trouble is, crime suddenly appears scarce in the small town, and Angela is forced to fight off boredom instead. Suddenly, something happens. Angela is unsure of what the something is, but while using her father's spy-noculars, she spots a happening at the Manoir mansion. Angela climbs through Nanette's bedroom window, honing in on the criminal element. Unfortunately, as Angela enters, the seemingly miniature crook disappears. Nanette accuses Angela of being the Tapwater Springs crook, and Angela must prove her innocence. She does so, revealing that Oo-La-La, Nanette's precious purebred French poodle, has been treating Manoir heirlooms like common bones!</Overview>

  <Overview>French Connection 
 
Angela is anticipating the arrival of an exchange student from Europe who is to stay with her family. She imagines the girl will turn out to be just like the sister she has always dreamed of, but it turns out that Cici is from France and is the total embodiment of all things French. Angela is disappointed to discover that her fantasy sister has more in common with real life nemesis Nanette. Instead of letting this coincidence get her down, Angela decides to use Cici to her advantage. With Cici's help, Angela hopes that Nanette's French façade can finally be exposed, only Angela's schemes hardly ever go according to plan, and Nanette and Cici become fast friends. Cici even invites Nanette to a slumber party. Imagine Angela's surprise when she walks into her bedroom to find January, Karlene and Nanette pillow fighting on top of her very own bed! Angela has had quite enough of her exchange school sister and wants to trade her in. Luckily, Nanette has been hiding a Dutch exchange student at the Manoir mansion who has too much in common with Angela, and for the first time in history, they agree on something...switching exchange students! 
 
The List 
 
A freak fire sprinkler accident has turned the halls of Tapwater Springs Elementary into an ice rink. Angela and friends struggle their way to class over ice covered floors. Eager to show off the special shoes her father invented, Angela glides to class like a world class skater. Her graceful poise comes to an abrupt stop when she falls flat on her derrière. Twice! Angela is triply humiliated when everyone decides to crack jokes at her expense. Angela is furious and she decides to get even by creating a list of everything about everyone else that annoys her. With this list, Angela will be prepared with a response for any insult that comes her way. But the next thing to come her way is a peace offering from her friends. They are proud of the seemingly great way she handled their good-natured ribbing. No longer angry, Angela tosses away the list only to have it promptly discovered by Nanette who sees the list as an opportunity to blackmail Angela into slavery. It seems that only the truth shall set Angela free.</Overview>

  <Overview>Brinks of No Return 
 
Today is a good day because an after-school snack awaits Angela. When finally the school bell rings, Angela rushes out to meet her mother. A few hours go by and Angela is still without snack because she is still at school awaiting her mother's arrival. Just then, Mrs. Brinks arrives with good news. Geneva is fine but her car has broken down. Angela is to go with Mrs. Brinks to the Brinks' Household. Okay, so maybe the good news isn't so good and Angela's good day has definitely turned bad. Angela will not only be spending the afternoon with Mrs. Brinks, but husband Connie too. And, Mrs. Brinks at home is just like Mrs. Brinks at school - a bullying tyrant! She even goes as far as punishing Angela and Connie for not knowing where a pimento loaf is. When it seems Angela's day couldn't get any darker, Nanette shows up for afternoon tea. Angela must flee if freedom is to be hers. With the help of Connie, an escape is quickly made. It just might turn out to be a good day after all. 
 
Operation Ringside 
 
Sunday afternoon and the kids fill the day and their stomachs with day old Abatti pizza. Everyone, that is, except Gordy Rhinehart. Gordy has spent a month's worth of Sundays without his father. Coach Rhinehart has been pre-occupied with something, but what that something is no one knows. And Gordy is having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that the something in his father's life might be more important then Gordy himself. Suddenly, a wrestling commercial featuring the Masked Menace appears on television. Various clues from said commercial lead Angela to believe Coach Rhinehart has taken to a double life in the squared circle. In order to prove her wrestling theory, Angela and friends go ringside with hopes of unmasking the Masked Menace and revealing him to be Coach Rhinehart. Then they will force him to give up this other life. There's just one catch - the Coach hasn't wrestled in years. He's been coaching the Masked Menace in an effort to raise money for Gordy's figure skating lessons. Even when father and son are apart, their thoughts are with each other.</Overview>

  <Overview>Eating With the Enemy 
 
Bill has just won the Annual Tapwater Springs Inno-ventor contest with his spectacular, accidental invention, the Food Rejuvenator 3000. And thanks to Angela's big mouth, Howell Manoir, is interested in investing in the device. Bill invites the Manoirs over for dinner so he can promote the Rejuvinator and negotiate a contract. Bill is positive that this could be his chance to make a lot of money and goes to great lengths to make sure everything is perfect for the meal. Angela is to be on her best behaviour. The Manoirs arrive and manage to insult with every compliment they give. Poor Geneva is at her breaking point. As for Angela, when she learns that Nanette has to be on her best behaviour, she manipulates the situation to make Nanette do whatever she wants. Nanette, of course, turns things around to her advantage and soon Angela is miserable again. Bill watches the evening unfold and decides that maybe money is not what he wants. Especially if it means the Anaconda family will start to resemble the Manoirs. 
 
Brocc-Fest 
 
It is the annual Tapwater Springs Broccoli Festival and the children are made to enter a broccoli poster-making contest. Angela is not happy. Firstly, everyone knows Nanette is going to win the contest, so what's the point?! Secondly, Angela hates the bushy green, which makes creating a poster in celebration of it even harder. Luckily, Angela discovers that Baby Lulu has a broccoli shaped head. Angela uses Baby Lulu as inspiration and creates a poster of the cutest broccoli anyone in Tapwater Springs has ever seen. To her amazement, Angela wins the contest while poor Nanette is runner up. Angela becomes the &quot;keeper of the broccoli&quot; and must give a speech extolling its virtues in front of the whole town. This forces her to find a way in which she can appreciate the funky florets or give up her title. However, in doing that, Nanette would become the &quot;keeper&quot; and letting Nanette win is almost as bad as the vegetable itself.</Overview>

On Halloween night, in order to avoid hurting Geneva's feelings, Angela wears the &quot;bunny&quot; costume...until she gets outside. Once outside, Angela changes into her &quot;nut&quot; costume. Her friends think Angela's costume is incredibly cool. Nanette decides to get Angela into trouble by exposing the costume charade to Geneva. But Geneva doesn't get angry at all.

  <Overview>The Lion, The Witch, And The Weasel 
 
The best thing about field trips is that you're not in school. And when you're not in school you don't have to do any assignments. This is Angela's logic and why, as the class leaves for the Tapwater Springs Zoo, she is happy. That is until Nanette suggests to Mrs. Brinks that the class do an assignment on a zoo animal. To make matters worse, Nanette gets to do her assignment on the lion, which is the animal Angela wants. Angela is stuck with the weasel, a weasel that hasn't been seen since 1987! How is Angela supposed to do a report on an animal she can't even see? Angela must think of a way to lure the weasel out of its hole. She tries to win over the weasel with reason, and fails. She tries trickery but that fails too. As time goes by, Angela wants nothing more then to eat and figures maybe that's what the weasel wants too. Sure enough, the weasel pops out of its hole when tempted by Nanette's nuts. And when the zookeeper gets angry that an animal was fed, Nanette gets the blame, because after all, they were her nuts. Hey, field trips are great things! 
 
Curse Of the Mummy 
 
The gang is on another field trip, this time to the local museum. An exhibit on ancient Egypt is clearly the most exciting. Nanette gets so excited over ancient gold, she knocks Angela into a Mummy. The Mummy topples onto Angela. Normally, this wouldn't be a bad thing, except in this instance the Mummy is cursed. Since Angela touched the Mummy, everyone assumes that she is cursed too and wants nothing to do with her. Only Johnny, Gordy and Gina believe that their pal is curse free. They all agree to help Angela. But all too soon Angela is hit with some unfortunate coincidences, AKA bad luck, and her friends desert her too. If her life seems like it couldn't get any worse, it does. Angela is partnered with Nanette to do a science project. Nanette gets enraged over this turn of events and while throwing a fit, bumps into Angela. Normally, this wouldn't be a bad thing, except in this instance Angela is cursed. Since Nanette touched Angela the curse passes on to her. Now it is Nanette who everyone stays away from!</Overview>

  <Overview>No Thanksgiving 
 
Gina invites Angela to the annual Thanksgiving Lash Bash. Angela declines. The Anaconda household believes Thanksgiving is for family and so with her family Angela will stay. And though Angela loves her family, she does not enjoy spending Thanksgiving with them. The Anacondas have never had a successful Turkey Day no matter how hard they've tried. However, this year, they've decided to try harder. Each family member will concentrate on making the perfect Thanksgiving dish. Angela gets to be in charge of helping. Things start out smoothly, until Nanette briefly appears, coughing up a storm. Nanette parts and all Anacondas but Angela come down with the stomach flu! Thanksgiving is ruined again. Angela decides to crash the Lash Bash but Gina will not permit Angela in. Angela is contagious and could get everyone else sick. But Gina, being Gina, would never let Angela down. Just as the festive day seems to be at its bleakest, Gina leaves a full dinner at the Anaconda door. Angela's family makes a miraculous recovery and, yes indeed, there is reason to be thankful. 
 
Family Tree 
 
While researching her family history for a class project, Angela discovers that the Anacondas of yesteryear owned Miss Nettie. Miss Nettie is the cow, according to legend, that saved Tapwater Springs from a devastating fire. Nanette claims it was actually the Manoirs of yesteryear that owned the famed bovine. Angela sets out to prove Nanette wrong. She discovers an old partial photo of an Anaconda pulling the aforementioned cow. But, Angela's proof only proves Nanette right. See Nanette also has a piece of the same photograph. Side by side the pieces reveal a Manoir descendant riding the cow that an Anaconda descendant is pulling. The Anacondas were the Manoirs' milkmaids! The humiliation is overwhelming. Just then, Grandma Lou appears. Grandma Lou has a third and final piece of the Miss Nettie photograph puzzle. It reveals Miss Nettie actually kicked the lantern-the lantern that started the fire, which almost burned down Tapwater Springs way back when! Phew. Good thing Angela wasn't the real owner of Miss Nettie. Would you want to be related to the cow that almost destroyed your town?!</Overview>

What a surprise when Mrs. Brinks reveals that she has been offered a dream teaching position-at another school! Angela's not-so-secret wish of wanting to get rid of Mrs. Brinks may finally come true. All Angela and her pals have to do is be on their best behavior when the principal from the new school comes to inspect Mrs. Brinks' teaching methods. There's only one problem: Nanette doesn't want Mrs. Brinks to leave. So, when Dr. Fanny (the principal) arrives, Nanette behaves like Angela normally would. Even January and Karlene join in the truancy act, resorting to deeds they must have picked up from Johnny Abatti. If Angela doesn't do something soon, Mrs. Brinks will never go away. Unfortunately for Angela, it appears she has already done too much. Mrs. Brinks is so touched by Angela's new angelic demeanor, she decides to stay at Tapwater Springs Elementary in order to be with her new favorite pupil! 
 
The Birdlady Of Tapwater Springs

Johnny and Josephine are stunned too. They feel that Angela's touch healed the bird. Soon the whole school knows of Angela's healing powers. They offer her all sorts of goodies so she will use her magical powers on them. Of course Angela knows that she doesn't have any special powers but if she can make people happy and get cool perks while doing it, then where's the harm? But when Mrs. Brinks gets wind of Angela's voodoo, she demands that Angela give her the ability to dance again. Somehow Mrs. Brinks does manage to do a very brief and very bad two-step.

  <Overview>Return To Sender 
 
Angela has been waiting a whole month for this very moment. Angela and her friends signed up for pen pals while on a trip to the museum. And today, Angela's letter from her pan pal has arrived. While everyone has cool pen pals - Gina gets food from hers - Gordy's pen pal is a ballerina - Angela by far has the best pen pal ever. Marie Antoinette (the aforementioned letter writer) writes pages and pages of really neat stuff. So great is Marie Antoinette and her prolific writing abilities, that Nanette engages in a pen pal competition with Angela . Nanette is positive her pen pal is the very best and is determined to prove it. But soon Nanette discovers that due to a pen pal mix up at the museum, her and Angela have unknowingly exchanged letters. Completely embarrassed, Nanette pretends to have known Angela was her pen pal all along. The next letter Marie Antoinette sends to Angelita (Angela's nom de plume) is viscous and nasty and poor Angela is crushed. When Angela finally learns the truth behind Marie Antoinette she decides to get even the best way she knows how. She uses Nanette's own words against her. 
 
I Wanna Mold Your Band 
 
Mr. Tastee Twirl is holding a talent contest in which the winner will get to ride with him in the Tastee Twirl truck and ring the Tastee Twirl bell. None of Angela's friends think they have any talent that would win them such a coveted prize. Well, Johnny has a so-so ventriloquist act with his puppet Sir Ducksworthy, but Angela isn't sure that's enough to win. Angela suggests that the gang reform their old band: Angela And Her Band-A-Condas! The gang isn't so gung-ho about the idea. It turns out that when the friends first formed the band, many years ago, Angela kind of got out of hand. Everyone has since vowed to never be in a music group together, no matter what. Then Nanette and her clone club show up and gloat about their band, the Oo-La-La-La-Las. If Nanette wins, she'll get to ring the Tastee Twirl bell and ice cream will be ruined forever. So the Band-A-Condas are quickly reborn. But with more in-fighting to deal with then the Beetles had when Yoko became a factor, the Band-A-Condas' band battle is all up hill.</Overview>

  <Overview>Don't Be Caddie 
 
Today is the hottest day in Tapwater Springs and Angela and her pals decide to cool off in Nonna's water sprinklers. Unfortunately Tapwater Springs is experiencing a drought and the Mayor has ordered all citizens to conserve water. Just when it seems Gordy will die from his heat rash, the friends stumble across the Tapwater Country Club and its big, beautiful pool. Angela would love to jump in, but the pool is for members only. What's a girl to do? Well, it just so happens that Mark and Derek have jobs at the Club. With a little help from her parents, Angela's brothers agree to get Angela and friends pool time. But there's a catch. The next day the gang has to do caddie duty. They must help golfers choose the appropriate clubs and also retrieve lost golf balls. Everyone takes their job a little too seriously, retrieving golf balls just as players place them on the tee. Mark and Derek are impressed with Angela's work but never had any intention of actually letting her swim. The pool is being cleaned and it's empty! Angela has two choices: either fill the pool herself, or get an invitation to the Country Club from someone other then her brothers. 
 
The Pup Who Would Be King 
 
Thanks to King, Angela and her friends get to witness the miracle of birth. King bares four adorable puppies. Angela is immediately taken with a scrappy one that affectionately bites her nose. But Geneva doesn't want any puppies in the house. One dog is enough for the Anacondas and the puppies will be given away. The next day, when Angela returns home from detention, all but the scrappy puppy are gone. Angela promises to find the perfect home for her favorite pup. She interviews many Tapwater residents but none live up to her high standards. Geneva's standards aren't so high. She knows of a perfect place for the puppy to go to. Geneva gives the puppy to Mrs. Brinks! Well, Angela is livid and enlists her friends to help save the puppy from this terrible fate. Can you imagine how horrible it must be to have to lick Mrs. Brinks' face? The more Angela tries to save the puppy, the more apparent it becomes that the puppy truly loves Mrs. Brinks. It seems anything is possible.</Overview>

  <Overview>Cheese Under Pressure 
 
The liverwurst sandwiches that Geneva gives to Angela everyday for lunch are becoming less appetizing. In fact, Angela isn't the only person bored with her lunch. The whole school seems unhappy with what their parents have packed and Angela suggests they all trade. There's only one problem-nobody wants Angela's lunch. Angela figures the answer to her problems is to bring something for lunch that every kid would want. So she brings peanut butter and jelly with her. But a kid can get peanut butter any old time and Angela is left out of the trading. Next stop: the supermarket. Surely Angela can get something cool to eat there. And she does. She discovers Squiggly Cheese, the artificial spray cheese from a can that not only tastes good, its fun to play with. Instantly Angela is the envy of the lunch room crowd. Even Nanette wants to trade with her! Will Angela trade away the best lunch she's had in a long while? Or will Nanette just manipulate Angela into giving her the coveted Squiggly Cheese? 
 
Troop Or Consequences 
 
Angela and Gina love being part of the Junior Ranger-ettes. They however don't love that Karlene and January are about to elect Nanette troop leader in an upcoming vote. Angela and Gina must recruit some new Ranger-ettes to prevent this from happening. They try desperately to recruit Josephine. She turns them down. The only girl who shows interest in becoming a Ranger-ette is actually-a boy! Gordy Rhinehart loves the crafts and other neat things the Ranger-ettes do. Being a Rangerette would also let Gordy be close to Gina Lash. When Nanette is unable to prevent Gordy from joining the troop, she points out that Gordy needs ten achievement pins before he can qualify to vote for troop leader. It would take a miracle for Gordy to get ten pins in time for the vote. But with sheer determination Gordy gets nine pins. Can Nanette foil Gordy before he reaches pin number 10?</Overview>

Angela is eager to lend a hand but Nanette soon shows up to offer her abilities - Nanette will do almost anything for a spotlight. The archenemies compete with each other to impress Johnny until Nanette abruptly takes herself out of the competition. Nanette has figured out that Johnny is a horrible magician. Gina is the one who makes the magic work. Will Angela make the connection before Johnny &quot;magically&quot; saws her in half? 
 
Stupid Cupid 
 
Gordy Rhinehart has written a love letter to Gina Lash, which Angela offers to deliver. Needless to say, the letter never makes it to Gina-her mother gets it instead. Liz Lash is convinced Coach Rhinehart wrote the letter. The two start up an instant romance and Angela's friends are furious at her. Gina is upset because Coach is always at her house eating her food. Gordy is upset because Coach is too busy with Liz to spend time with him. And Gina still doesn't know how much in love with her Gordy is! Even Johnny is upset. Uncle Nicky has always had a crush on Liz and spends his days moping now that she and Coach have hooked up. And if Angela had delivered the letter properly in the first place, none of this would have happened. Angela tries to break up the happy couple but only makes matters worse. Soon, the whole town is affected by the Lash/Rhinehart coupling and they direct their anger at Angela. Angela quickly discovers that what the people of Tapwater really need is to be in love themselves. Can Angela succeed in being Cupid for everyone and bring love to town?</Overview>

Everyone has microscopic bugs all over their body. This revelation offers little comfort and sends Gordy into a state of panic. He wears protective gloves and masks and keeps his distance from his friends lest their parasites find their way onto him. Then Gordy learns that it's just not other people's germs that he has to fear. Even inanimate objects such as books and food have parasites. Gordy doesn't know where to put himself. Angela tries to help but everything she tries backfires. Soon Gordy has no other alternative but to sit in a bathtub all day. Will Angela be able to calm her friend before he shrivels away? Or is Gordy destined to live in a plastic bubble forever?

  <Overview>Sound Of Silence 
 
Coach Rhinehart has lost his voice and football practice has been cancelled. Mark and Derek are left with nothing to do but torture poor Angela. To make matters worse, if Mark and Derek's football team lose their next game, they won't make it to the playoffs. This means even more time on their hands - even more time to torture their sister. Angela must find a way for Coach to get healthy again. While failing at playing doctor, Angela discovers that Gordy has the ability to understand Coach's silent gestures. Gordy can interpret for Coach on the football field. Football practice is on again. But Gordy's interpretations of Coach's unique sign language are quite flowery. In fact, the football players have a hard time understanding exactly what Gordy is trying to say. When Gordy tries to get aggressive, he loses his voice too! Once again Angela is forced to take matters into her own hands. Now when Coach makes a gesture, Gordy interprets it with his own. Angela in turn interprets Gordy. And somehow, as improbable as it seems, the team wins with one spectacular maneuver. Angela is a hero. 
 
Johnny Learns To Swing 
 
Angela innocently discovers something strange on Johnny's chest. None of the kids knows what it is but Uncle Nicky recognizes it. Johnny has genuine Abatti chest hair. This, of course, means Johnny is a man and Uncle Nicky must now teach his young charge the ways in which a real man behaves. The next day when Angela and friends pick Johnny up to go to school, Johnny is no where to be found. Their friend has morphed into John-O - a miniature Uncle Nicky, complete with leisure suit and lady-killer attitude. Angela has a few reservations. Johnny is trying to act older and his coolness is getting in the way of having fun. But Nanette seems repulsed by John-O's new charms and, if he can upset Nanette, he can still be Angela's friend! All too soon though the charm turns to smarm and Nanette falls for the insincerity John-O is oozing. Thankfully, Johnny is unable to give up his spitball addiction, something Uncle Nicky says is a manly no-no. Maybe Johnny can be rescued from John-O after all.</Overview>

Race Car Race 
 
Parents in Tapwater Springs are busy helping their child build a soapbox-racing car for an upcoming race. Every car is unique, built with care to reflect the child's personality. For example: Gina's car has a built in doughnut holder and Gordy's is filled with flowers. Unsurprisingly, Nanette's car is a store bought one and it's really fast. Angela, Gina, Johnny and Gordy decide to take the best parts of their own cars and combine them into one super car. And since Johnny is deemed the best driver, he gets to drive. During practice Johnny gets into an accident. Disappointed with himself, Johnny is convinced he has lost his racing magic. He no longer feels he is able to beat Nanette and Angela must now sit it the driver's seat. While racing, Nanette cheats, causing Angela's racecar to lose two of its wheels. Just when it seems that all is lost, Angela convinces Johnny to work his racing magic and get back behind the wheel. To which he does, proving that a Johnny with two homemade wheels is better then a Nanette with four store bought.</Overview>

  <Overview>Jimmy Jamal, Super Beetle 
 
Jimmy Jamal has been acting weird lately. He thinks he's a super hero, Super Beetle to be exact. Some people are willing to believe in Jimmy's crime fighting powers. Angela and her pals are skeptical. Johnny offers to try and talk some sense into him. This turns out to be a mistake. Jimmy ends up convincing Johnny that he would make a great sidekick. Thus Krazy Kricket, nee Johnny Abatti, is born! But what's this?! There seems to be a crime in Tapwater Elementary that needs to be solved after all. Sherman, the class chicken, has gone missing. All fingers point to Angela as being the chicken snatcher. The once skeptical Angela is now forced to beg Super Beetle and Krazy Kricket to prove her innocence. They carefully gather all sorts of clues and evidence only to reveal... Angela is guilty. This crime-fighting duo is really a crime-fighting dud. It looks like Angela will have to solve this chicken caper herself. 
 
I'm With Stupid 
 
Show and Tell grows increasingly boring every time it's Angela's turn to show and tell. The things she brings to share with the class just aren't very interesting. Angela needs to find something that will grab everyone's attention. She enlists the help of her father. He offers her the use of his former ventriloquism dummy - a cow named Mr. Mooey. Mr. Mooey is an instant hit with the class. They love his cow-rific puns and biting sense of humor. What Angela's class doesn't seem to realize, is that Mr. Mooey is merely an extension of Angela. In fact, everyone becomes so enamoured with the wooden bovine he becomes the center of attention while Angela is completely ignored. When Angela leaves Mr. Mooey at home, her friends become upset at his absence. It seems that the only way for Angela to win her friends back from Mr. Mooey is to turn him into Mr. Meany. Soon the cow's caustic jokes turn Angela's friends against him and she gladly puts him back in storage.</Overview>

A new boy, Stu Wu, has moved into the neighborhood and Angela is the first to meet him. He seems incredibly cool. Angela hurries to find her friends so they can meet him too. While waiting for Gina, Johnny and Gordy to show up, Angela decides to help Stu unpack. Suddenly, Stu seems incredibly creepy. His coolness is gone. Angela leaves in order to tell her friends to not bother meeting Stu. They don't believe her and insist on meeting him anyway. To them, Stu seems like a great kid. He even lets them play with his skateboard. Angela finally relents and decides maybe Stu isn't a creep. So she decides to help him decorate his room. She runs to her house to get a few things.

Open All Night 
 
Angela is having trouble falling asleep. In fact, she hasn't slept in a couple of days - ever since a water main broke in her house. The lack of sleep is starting to take its toll. She's putting toothpaste in her hair, putting clothes on backwards, she's even tripping over her friends. Clearly something has to be done. Gina, Gordy and Johnny decide to help Angela cure herself of the dreaded insomnia. Gina thinks a full stomach will help Angela and is quickly feeding her. The food makes Angela more ill then tired. Gordy suggests aroma- therapy candles. Unfortunately, just as the candles are lit, the fire alarms are set off. Since school has always put Johnny to sleep, he suggests a mental test will tire Angela out. However, he poses a question that no one can answer, and Angela becomes frantic thinking about it. The only solution now is to trace her steps and find out what use to put her to sleep. Turns out... it was a drippy faucet that caused the water main to brake a couple of days ago!</Overview>

  <Overview>The Curse Of Baby Lulu 
 
Baby Lulu utters a bad word. Bill and Geneva are aghast and demand to know who taught the baby such filth. They go around the room, questioning those who came into contact with Lulu today. Uncle Nicky was the last to handle her. He was dropping by the house to pick up Johnny when Mark and Derek left the tot in his care. But all he did was play &quot;this little piggie&quot; with her. He's innocent! Well, Mark and Derek had Lulu before Nicky. Surely they must be guilty of teaching her smut. However, they're innocent too. All they did was try to teach Lulu how to play football. Which leaves-Angela. She took care of Lulu for most of the day. And, Angela has never been one to shy away from trouble. Clearly she is the culprit. Bill is about to lay punishment when he suddenly remembers something. He actually had Lulu before Angela. And while he was taking care of her, he hurt his finger - badly! So maybe Angela isn't guilty, and needn't be punished. That said - who gets to punish Bill?! 
 
Funny Photos 
 
Angela and her friends discover a section of the newspaper known as &quot;Funny Photos&quot;. This is where embarrassing photos of local townspeople are printed. Not only are the pictures hilarious, they can be profitable. The newspaper pays people for their funny submissions. The kids take pictures of themselves making silly faces and send them off. They are promptly rejected and told that their photos lack humor. Ever resourceful, the friends decide to orchestrate some &quot;accidents&quot;. They start off by creating a huge mud puddle surrounded by banana peels. Surely someone will jog by, slip in, and provide the perfect photo opportunity. The scheme backfires. As do all their later schemes. Every time Angela attempts to embarrass someone else, she or one of her friends become victims of their own plans. Conveniently enough, Nanette has been present for all of Angela's backfired schemes. And thanks to Nanette, Angela's pictures do end up in the &quot;Funny Photos&quot; section after all - however, Angela's not the photographer.</Overview>

  <Overview>Nonna's Lib 
 
Nonna Abatti is late getting to a library book sale. The only book left that seems appealing is one entitled &quot;The Cry of the She-Wolf&quot;. It turns out to be a feminist manifesto. A few chapters in, Nonna realizes that as a woman, she's being taken advantage of. She will no longer be a slave to the kitchen and denounces the possibility of any future pizza making. Well, Angela and her friends are happy that Nonna is taking charge of her own life. But they wish she'd leave her wonderful pizza out of the process. Uncle Nicky doesn't know the secret recipe. The kids try to help him out but only Gordy knows how to cook. And all he can make are eggs! The kids tell Nonna that she is greatly missed in an effort to win her back. She misunderstands their compliments and only gets angrier. All hope seems lost until Nonna finally gets to the final chapter of &quot;She Wolf&quot;. There, Nonna reads that an independent woman should have her own business and be her own boss. Thanks to Abatti's pizza, she is an independent woman. So really, there's never been any shame in making pizza.

  <Overview>Diving Miss Angela 
 
While on a field trip to Oceanland, Angela falls in love with the whales. She wants to become a marine biologist. Grandma Lou is over for a visit and she's brought along a periscope. This piece of equipment is all Angela needs to begin. She is soon at the beach with her friends, searching for signs of sea-life. They happen upon Ms. Yamagachi's scuba diving class. What luck! Angela would love to take lessons. Unfortunately, she's too young. Nanette is in the class; however, she has previous experience bought for her by her father. Angela needs scuba experience in order to take the class. She will need an instructor. Grandma Lou will do in a pinch! Grandma Lou won't let Angela swim in the lake for her first dive, too dangerous. They need to find a pool. Nanette has a pool but she would never let Angela swim in it. Grandma Lou suggests that they use it anyway, when nobody is looking. Of course, they get caught. While in the pool, Angela finds some jewels Bunny Manoir was missing. Angela falls in love with the rocks and decides that instead of marine biologist, she'll become a geologist. 
 
Window Pain 
 
Geneva wants to enter an art contest with the local museum about the reality of family life. Angela suggests their family be used as inspiration. Geneva takes Angela's suggestion one step further and soon the Anaconda's find themselves living in a replica of their house as part of a museum exhibit. This means the Anaconda's are to live their lives with others watching. Angela's only break from being on view is when she's in class. She's hesitant at first. When she realizes that the museum patrons find her entertaining, she warms up to them. Some of them even help her with her homework. Maybe this art exhibit won't be so bad. Suddenly Nanette shows up just as Bill is doing something embarrassing. The incident is the talk of the school next day. In fact, everything that the Anaconda's do in the museum display is up for discussion. Angela hates being the center of this type of attention. The only way out of the situation, it seems, is to watch the audience and make them understand what it's like to be stared at.</Overview>

  <Overview>Enter The Angela 
 
Mark and Derek are torturing Angela in their normal brotherly fashion. Unable to do anything, she seeks out the help of Coach Rhinehart. He teaches her karate, in particular, he teaches her how to do a karate flip. Oddly enough, as soon as Angela learns these new skills, Mark and Derek stop bothering her. She begs them to bother her so that she can flip them. They're just not up to it. Angela asks her friends at school if anyone is interested in a karate demonstration. She's more then happy to flip a volunteer. Nobody seems particularly interested. Angela is itching to flip someone! On cue, Nanette comes by. She's half way through a sentence when Angela flips her. For no reason other then Nanette is always bothering her, it was pure reflex. Quickly Angela is brandished with the reputation of school bully. Not even her friends want to hang out with her. Self-defense is great when protecting yourself from others, but what do you do to protect yourself from you? 
 
If The Shoe Fits 
 
Angela is forced to accompany her brothers as her mother buys them a new pair of shoes. Since she doesn't go through shoes as quickly, she's not getting a new pair. Of course, there's no reason for her not to try on a pair of funky orange runners. A couple of distractions later, Angela is on her way home when she notices she forgot to take the store shoes off. She's a thief - but only by accident. She convinces her friends to help her return the shoes before she gets into trouble. In order to do that though, the orange shoes have to remain in perfect condition and Angela's parents can't find out. Angela's friends are forced to carry her over puddles and other such schemes. At one point, Angela has to cover her shoes with bags and invent a new game called &quot;bagfoot&quot; just to keep her parents from noticing anything out of the ordinary. Everything seems to work out fine. Angela makes it back to the store but there's a police officer at the entrance, waiting for somebody. Is Angela too late? Is the officer there to arrest her?</Overview>

Driving Me Crazy 
 
Today is the grand opening of a new toy store. As part of the celebration, a raffle is being held. A motorized car is the grand prize. There's one catch: in order to claim the prize, you have to be present when your name is called. Gina, Gordy and Johnny don't want to stick it out. They give their tickets to Angela and leave. Naturally, Angela wins. Though she's not sure with whose ticket. Her friends claim that since she might have won with one of their tickets, they all have ownership of the car. They reluctantly agree to share with one another. Greed gets the better of them and they decide to split the car in four quarters. Josephine, over hearing their problem, tries to help settle the matter. She tells them: who ever loves the car the most, should get to keep it. Each of them, in turn, demonstrates how much they love the car. Josephine concludes that they all love the car equally; but whoever loves the car the most will set it free. Each in turn sets the car free. Now that the car belongs to no one, Josephine is more then happy to take ownership of it!</Overview>
