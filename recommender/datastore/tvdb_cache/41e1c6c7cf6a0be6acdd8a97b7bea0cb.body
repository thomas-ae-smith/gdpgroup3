The Ballad of Rocket Robin Hood (lyrics) Come gather around me,
Space travelers surround me,
Hark now to the ballad of Rocket Robin Hood. I may well confound you,
Astound you, spellbound you,
With heroes and villains, the bad and the good. Watch now as our rockets race here from afar,
For now, with our Robin, we live on a star!
...Three. Two. One. Blast off! Band of brothers, marching together.
Heads held high in all kinds of weather.
With fiery blasts, our roaring rockets rise,
Beyond the air, beyond the skies!
At the sight of Robin, take your stand,
With the gallant leader of our band.
Send a joyous shout throughout the land
For Rocket! Robin Hoo</Overview>
