<Overview>Britain at War is a ten-part series that provides a powerful social and military history of Great Britain during the Second World War.

The result is an extraordinary collection of interviews; testimonies from a unique generation that lived and survived the uncertainties and the horrors of the Second World War.

Other elements of the programmes include superb archive footage and graphics which are combined with fascinating cinema newsreel films to give a real taste and flavour of the times.</Overview>

<Overview>In this major series, Professor Robert Bartlett examines the extraordinary expansion and unchecked ambition of the Normans, and shows how they transformed the history of Europe.

A Quote from Ralph, Bishop of Orkney

‘Most famous Normans, as you go into battle, remember your name and your ancestry. No one has resisted you and been unscathed. Bold France melted away in front of you. You conquered and subjugated fertile England. Rich Apulia flourished again when she received you. The celebrated city of Jerusalem and the renowned city of Antioch both submitted to you’ (Ralph, Bishop of Orkney, as recounted by Henry of Huntingdon).

<SeriesName>Parenthood (2010)</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/94551-g3.jpg</banner>
<Overview>From writer/executive producer Jason Katims (Friday Night Lights) -- this contemporary re-imagining of the blockbuster film depicts the colorful and imperfect Braverman family -- four grown siblings sharing the headaches, heartaches and joy of being parents. The star-studded cast includes Peter Krause, Lauren Graham, Craig T. Nelson, Dax Shepard, Bonnie Bedelia, Monica Potter, Erika Christensen and Sarah Ramos. When Sarah Braverman (Graham, Gilmore Girls), a financially strapped single mother, returns home to her parents and siblings in Berkeley, Calif. after packing up her Fresno apartment and uprooting her two inconvenienced kids, Amber (Mae Whitman) and Drew (Miles Heizer), she is greeted by her opinionated father, Zeek (Nelson), and strong mother, Camille (Bedelia) who are privately dealing with their own marital issues. As Sarah is reunited with her siblings -- sister, Julia (Christensen), and brothers Crosby (Shepard) and Adam (Krause) -- all struggling with issues of their own, it's clear that the Braverman reunion is just what they need to face the everyday challenges of modern family life.</Overview>
