  <Overview>Series confronting some of the emotional dilemmas people face in writing a will and help them with the often taboo and neglected task of working out how to evaluate and divide their estate.

An astonishing 70 percent of us will go to our graves without ever making a will. However, dying without a legally valid will, or having written an incorrect one, can lead to loved ones receiving nothing and could even tear a family apart. Each week Sir Gerry Robinson, one of the country's leading businessmen, and top legal expert Sue Medder will help two families face up to writing their wills, bringing friends and relatives together to discuss who gets what and why.</Overview>

  <Overview>Lesley wants to leave half the family home to charity, but husband David wants all of it to be left to his two sons by a previous marriage.

Meanwhile, army major Tom is bound for Baghdad, and urgently needs to make a will that includes his two stepdaughters. But his new wife Kiera is against the principle of inheritance and would rather leave everything they jointly own to charity.

Both couples need to face some uncomfortable home truths before they sign on the dotted line.

Sir Gerry is assisted by top lawyer Sue Medder, who sets out the legal options in each case, and writes the final wills. And Sir Gerry gets all the family involved in the debate, because keeping problems secret is no way to solve them.

Deciding who gets what in a will can be one of the toughest choices anyone can have to make. But making no decisions at all and dying without a will can cause rifts that tear families apart.</Overview>
