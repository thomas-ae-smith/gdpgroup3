<Overview>In high school, there are the students who rule the school -- like jocks, cheerleaders, and the popular kids -- and the ones who get picked on -- like nerds, emos, and outcasts. That's just high school, right? But what if you could change that?

Like a reality version of The Breakfast Club, each episode of If You Really Knew Me takes place at a different high school, and follows five students from different cliques as they go through the life-changing experience of Challenge Day, a one-day program that breaks down the walls between cliques, and completely changes the way students view their school and each other. Watch the amazing transformation each week as new students open up for the first time and try to change by revealing who they really are, behind the cliques and the labels. Is it possible to change your life, and maybe even your high school, in one day? These students are going to find out... on If You Really Knew Me. </Overview>

<banner>graphical/248008-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Sing If You Can sees some of Britain’s most popular celebrities taken out of their comfort zone to perform in extreme and hilarious circumstances.

Hosted by comedian Keith Lemon and Queen of the Jungle Stacey Solomon, every episode will see two celebrity teams trying to belt out modern hits and classic crowd-pleasers while taking on extraordinary challenges designed to distract them.

Will the celebs hold their nerve while performing a song from a specially-designed erupting volcano? Or complete a solo while having their chest waxed?

Each episode features a celebrity judging panel, who will cast an irreverent eye over proceedings.  Ultimately, however, it will be the studio audience to decide which team goes through to the end game. The stakes are high as one celebrity from the losing team will be plunged into a giant water tank.

In the end game, the winning team can win money for the show’s nominated charity – Teenage Cancer Trust. The final song is performed on a giant turntable that spins faster and faster. The longer the team can keep their balance, the more they win for charity…</Overview>
