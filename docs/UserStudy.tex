\section{User Study}
	\subsection{Overview}
	A study was performed in which the change in user engagement was measured upon being presented with interactive and non-interactive advertisements. To estimate user engagement, two known correlating measurements were taken: information recall\citep{} and time perception\citep{yahoo-intrusive-advertising}.

	\subsection{Methodology}
	Using a set of 119 student targeted adverts taken from Project4, 8 were given interactive html/css overlays containing interactive content likely to be typical for an interactive TV advert. Each participant in the study was shown two rounds of adverts---one interactive and one non-interactive---with half the participants being shown the interactive adverts first, and the other half shown non-interactive adverts first. The length of the rounds varied between 4, 5, and 6 minutes, and were evenly split between longer interactive rounds, longer non-interactive rounds and equal length rounds; the purpose of which was to measure differences in the participants perceived time and actual round time. 

	The study was scripted, which has been included in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_interview_script}. While participants were neither encouraged nor discouraged from interacting with the interactive set of adverts, they were informed that interactions were possible, and how to interact, removing the initial learning period. As part of the study, an video introduction was given, which is included in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_video_script}.

			Unified Insurance Cover & \textbf{Information}: The user may select possessions they own, and are given an estimated insurance quote. \\
			Dominoes Pizza & \textbf{Purchase}: The user may interact witht he advert to order a pizza. \\
			\url{www.thetrainline.com} & \textbf{Poll}: The user may vote whether or not they think train tickets are too expensive, and are shown the poll results upon voting. \\

	\subsection{Results}

	Analysing the answer to question 2b (ii), ``\textit{Please estimate how much time more or less you were watching in the second session?}'', shows how users perceived time during the live and non-live rounds.
