\section{User Study}
	\subsection{Overview}
	A study was performed in which the change in user engagement was measured upon being presented with interactive and non-interactive advertisements. To estimate user engagement, two known correlating measurements were taken: information recall\cite{} and time perception\cite{yahoo-intrusive-advertising}.

	\subsection{Methodology}
	Using a set of 119 student targetted adverts taken from Project4, 8 were given interactive html/css overlays containing interactive content likely to be typical for an interactive TV advert. Each participant in the study was shown two rounds of adverts---one interactive and one non-interactive---with half the participants being shown the interactive adverts first, and the other half shown non-interactive adverts first. Participants were shown a total of

	minutes of adverts, but were split into three groups each with different ratios of interactive/non-interactive advert showing times: group 1 had a 5/5 split, group 2 a 4/6 split and group 3 a 6/4 split. Users were neigther encouraged nor discouraged from interacting with the interactive set of adverts.
