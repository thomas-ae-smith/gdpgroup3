\begin{abstract}
Studies have shown that online video viewership is growing at a pace beyond that of television broadcast consumption. Advertisers have begun to shift focus towards online platforms due to a number of persuasive factors: granular targeting of specific demographics; a large audience reach; rich metrics and feedback; a more suitable pricing strategy; and finally, the opportunity to increase purchase intent and brand awareness. However, TV remains the largest form of video consumption, and broadcasters can further exploit this viewer base by developing their own online-based platforms.

In this report, we present the findings of two studies. The first pertains to how people engage with live media: in a survey of 68 individuals, 49\%  claimed to rarely or never pay attention to television adverts. The second pertains to the effect of providing adverts that are targeted within minority groups and provide interactivity, which, in a user study of 18 individuals, shows an improvement in viewer engagement for x\% of participants. % TODO %

We will present the platform that we have developed for providing interactive and granularly targeted adverts, which we used for the latter study. We will demonstrate the practical usage for this through \textit{your4.tv}, a user-tailored TV streaming service that we have developed for tablet computers.
