\begin{abstract}
Studies have demonstrated that online video viewership is growing at a pace beyond that of television broadcast. Advertisers have begun to shift focus towards online platforms as they can provide granular targeting of specific demographics, larger audience reach, rich metrics and feedback, and the opportunity to increase purchase intent and brand awareness. Despite these advantages, TV remains the largest form of video consumption.

In this report, we present the findings of two studies. The first pertains to how people engage with live media: in a survey of 67 individuals, 49\% claimed to rarely or never pay attention to television adverts. The second pertains to the effect of providing adverts that are targeted within minority groups and provide interactivity, which, in a user study of 18 individuals, shows an improvement in viewer engagement for 71\% of participants. % TODO %

We present a platform that we have developed for providing interactive and granularly targeted adverts, which we used for the latter study. We demonstrate this in practice through \textit{Your4.tv}, a user-tailored TV streaming service that we developed for tablet computers, which is able to capture detailed advert consumption statistics that advertisers can use to determine who sees their adverts and how they interact with them.
