\section{Introduction}
Current TV streaming services - such as BBC iPlayer and 4oD - allow users to watch either Live TV or programmes that have been shown previously. This can be done via a web-interface on a computer. iPlayer and 4oD both have apps available for other platforms, such as the Sony PS3 and Android smartphones[check].

The customer, inqb8r, run a service called Project4, which similar to above, is a TV streaming service which also offers previously shown programmes. The service is aimed at students (specifically designed to be used on JA.NET) and shows Channel 4, four of its sister channels - E4, More4, 4Music and Film4 - and its own channel, studentTV.
