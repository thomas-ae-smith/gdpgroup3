\section{Interactive Adverts}
In this section we will show screen grabs of all stages of the interaction process within each advert. People seemed on average to prefer the interactive versions of the adverts and had some interesting feedback during our user study, a sampling of which is included below with each advert. The most common overall themes were that it gave people something to do if they were bored and that it made the adverts more enjoyable.

\subsection{Fosters}
	\begin{description}
		\item[On Load]{A Facebook ``Like'' button is present in the lower right hand part of the screen. See Figure~\ref{fig:fosters1}.}
