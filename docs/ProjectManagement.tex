\section{Project Management}

The team consists of five people, who have worked together on a scripting project previously. It was thus understood each others skills, which allowed tasks to be allocated effectively from the start. The team members are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Dexter Lowe} (Software Engineering MEng, Part 4): worked with enterprise systems, strong experience with Java, very familiar with Eclipse
\item \textit{Jim Skinner} (Computer Science MEng, Part 4): knowledgeable in areas of machine-learning, strong experience with Python
\item \textit{Tom Smith} (Computer Science MEng, Part 4): has experience with data-visualisation, strong experience with JavaScript
\item \textit{Adam Thomas} (Computer Science MEng, Part 4): experienced web developer, strong experience with JavaScript and PHP
\item \textit{Peter West} (Software Engineering MEng, Part 4): knowledgeable in user-interface design, strong experience with JavaScript and PHP
\end{enumerate}

During the first week on the project, the team made preparations for the project to begin and compiled a brief (see Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_brief}) that would describe the deliverable product. This started with a team meeting to discuss the specification that the client had provided, allowing the team to establish what discussion would need to take place with the customer and supervisors. This was key to agreeing on a project that would be achievable within the time and resource constraints.

During the meeting (attended by supervisor Les Carr and, from inqb8r, Peter Wood and Nick Culley),
