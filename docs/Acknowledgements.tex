\section{Acknowledgments}

Thanks to our supervisors, David Tarrant and Les Carr, whose guidance and provision of resources have ensured this.

Thanks to Peter Wood and Nick Culley from Inqb8r, developers of Project4, who provided feedback for our work and ensured that required resources were in place for the duration of the project. We would particularly like to thank Peter Wood for making himself available for queries and advice for the duration of the project.

We'd also like to thank Metabroadcast, in particular Jonathan Tweed, who have provided us with access to their Atlas API (atlasapi.org), a REST service for accessing EPG and programme data. This data is in turn provided by Press Association.

Thanks to GroupLens research for hosting MovieLens rating and demographic data, which were used to train the recommendation system. Thanks to TheTVDB for providing an API to programatically find the genres of movies, which was used for classifying new programmes by the recommender.

Finally, we'd like to thank VisualDNA for their support of this project, and their offer to provide assistance and mentoring. We would particularly like to thank the CTO of VisualDNA, Tomas Cervenka, for validating the utility of our project by showing interest in the outcome of this project and extending it further.
