\section{Acknowledgments}

Thanks to our supervisors, David Tarrant and Les Carr, whose guidance and provision of resources have ensured this.

Thanks to Peter Wood and Nick Culley from inqb8r, developers of Project4, who provided feedback for our work and ensured that resources were in place for the duration of the project.

We'd also like to thank Metabroadcast, in particular Jonathan Tweed, who have provided us with access to their Atlas API (atlasapi.org), a REST service for accessing EPG and programme data. This data is in turn provided by Press Association.

Finally, we'd like to thank VisualDNA for their support of this project.
