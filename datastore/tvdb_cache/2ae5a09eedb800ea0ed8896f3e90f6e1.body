<SeriesName>Dave Attell</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/257139-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Born in Queens, New York, to a Jewish family, he grew up in Rockville Centre, New York and now lives in New York City. Attell's initial motivation to perform stand-up comedy is attributed to his indecisiveness as to what he should do after college. In 1987 he graduated from New York University  with a degree in communications. Like many other fledgling comedians, he worked menial jobs during the day and put in his time at comedy clubs at night. He worked his first gig at Governor's in Levittown and, according to Attell, "totally bombed".[citation needed] After years of honing his act, he found himself being described as a "comedian's comedian".[citation needed] When working a club, the other comedians, such as Mike Royce (a producer/writer on Everybody Loves Raymond), David Juskow (a performer on TV Funhouse), Kevin Brennan (from Saturday Night Live and HBO's One Night Stand) and Jon Stewart, would come in to watch his act. While the audience didn't always follow his up-front delivery, fellow comedians were refreshed by his originality.[citation needed]

Attell often begins a joke in a relatively tame way, but then gets progressively stranger and ends in an obscene non sequitur. For example: "Sex is not important. What's important is that afterward part. When you're both naked and it's warm and you're watching the sun come up in the windshield. You look in her eyes, you look in her one good eye and help her strap on her leg and you know: you just fucked a pirate."</Overview>

<Overview>In 2003 Dave Gorman toured Britain with a show entitled Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure, and published a book of the same name. It is another true story. At 31 Dave decided to give up his stupid ways, grow a beard and write a novel. As a result Dave believes people took him more seriously and a new novel was commissioned. Whilst trying to write a novel for his publisher (Random House) Dave became obsessed with Googlewhacks, when someone notified him that his site had one (Francophile Namesakes), and caused him to travel across the world finding people who had authored them. He eventually spent his publisher's advance on the quest, and had to create the Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure show to pay them back.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Dave Gorman In America Unchained</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/166861-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>In Dave Gorman In America Unchained, the multi award-winning performer sets off on a journey to see if it's still possible to live in America without giving any money to 'The Man'. Travelling coast-to-coast, he's not staying in any chain hotels, eating in any chain restaurants, or filling up at any chain gas stations. On this journey, only independent "Mom &amp; Pop" businesses will do. Of course, travelling unchained in a chained world is tricky--when youâ€™re tired you can't just stop at a Starbucks, and when the tank is running empty you can't just pull up at the next gas station. Staying true to the task was always going to be a struggle, but the people facing the real struggle are those working to keep the unchained businesses of America alive.</Overview>
