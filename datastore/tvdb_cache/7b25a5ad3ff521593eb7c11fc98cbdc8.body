    <Overview>A zany cadre of aspiring cadets flocks to the world's favorite precinct - and gets accepted. Born leader Rich Casey clashes daily with vengeful Sergeant Rusty Ledbetter. Casey's new cadet party pals unintentionally help him set a bad example - among them sweet, farm-grown Annie Medford, brawny but dim-witted Luke Kackley, spunky biker Alicia Cervantes and the weapon-wielding Tackleberry brothers. Serving under the oblivious guidance of Commandant Hefilfinger, these cadets cope with the rigors of training and with the snitching of Ledbetter's informant, cadet Lester Shane. And, though part of the leadership team, man-of-a-thousand-sound-effects Larvell Jones still takes pleasure in harassing his superiors. From sight gags to wisecracks, from sham to slapstick, these guys round up the criminals while they round up the laughs and take them all to Police Academy: The Series.
