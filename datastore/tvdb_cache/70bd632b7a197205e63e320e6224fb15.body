<SeriesName>The Marriage Ref (UK)</SeriesName>
<Overview>The Marriage Ref looks at real-life couples who are very much in love, but have something quirky and ridiculous that they argue about. No tiff is too absurd for the show - from a couple who bicker about the husband's desire to stuff and display his beloved dead pooch... to a wife who is fed up of her husband taking his wedding ring off every time he goes out with his mates.

It's up to Dermot O'Leary and his panel of celebrities and comics to decide who's right and wrong in each of these domestic disputes - the husband or the wife. The show is described as being "packed with laughs as the guests discuss, debate and add their own personal take to each light-hearted and very funny tiff."</Overview>
