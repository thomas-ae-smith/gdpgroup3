<Overview>Larry the Cable Guy believes the United States of America is the greatest country on the face of the earth and he's out to prove it. In this new series, Larry crisscrosses the nation, going totally off the beaten path to find the people, places and things that define this nation's unique history. From panning for gold in the hills of California to leading a cavalry charge in a Civil War reenactment in Virginia, Larry gives history a fun, down-home twist in the new one-hour series Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy.

Each episode uncovers surprising information about America's history from the story of how moonshine-making during Prohibition gave rise to one of America's most celebrated past times - NASCAR racing - to the history of etiquette from Emily Post's heirs in Vermont, complete with a lesson in good manners.</Overview>
