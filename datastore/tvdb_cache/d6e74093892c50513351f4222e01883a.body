Take Jack (newcomer Matthew Long) and Bobby McCallister (Logan Lerman, The Butterfly Effect) for example: two bright young brothers growing up under the watchful eye of their eccentric single mother Grace McCallister (Christine Lahti, Chicago Hope). Grace's personality is a force of nature destined to shape both of these young men's lives and secure one a place in the history books - as President of the United States.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Young Black Jack</SeriesName>
<Overview>One Christmas day, 9-year-old Tokio (Ooe Shunsuke) had arranged to meet his mother Mitsuko (Toda Naho) at a shopping mall. At that moment, there is news that the criminal behind a series of bomb attacks in the metropolis has called the police with a warning about the next bomb. It has been rigged at the place where Tokio is waiting for his mother. Mitsuko desperately tries to save Tokio, but does not make it in time and gets caught up in the explosion. The two of them lose consciousness and are taken to Toukei University Hospital. The surgeon, Honma (Ichimura Masachika), operates on Tokio. His severed right hand and leg were stitched, and brown skin was transplanted on the half of his face which was burnt. Tokio miraculously survives. Prevented from seeing his mother until he makes a recovery, Tokio devotes himself to rehabilitation. And half a year later, he is reunited with her. However, she has continued to sleep without ever regaining consciousness. It is a big shock to him, but he is told by Honma, “Your mother may wake up if there are advances in medicine.” And so, he decides to become a doctor and awaken his mother. 15 years later, 24-year-old Tokio (Okada Masaki) is a student in medical school. He is later known as Young Black Jack, the unlicensed doctor who demands huge payment. Tokio lives with his mother, who has continued to be on life support equipment and remained in a state of suspended animation since 15 years ago, in a basement and searches for a method to wake her up. Yuna (Naka Riisa), a medical school student and daughter of the director of Toukei University Hospital, finds a lady who has collapsed on the street with a cardiopulmonary arrest. She tries to give her a cardiac massage. Tokio appears and says, “There is something that has to be done before the cardiac massage.” He saves the lady by applying the appropriate first aid procedures. Seeing the procedure, Yuna mistakes Tokio for a doctor. At that moment, he drops his pocket book and Yuna picks it up. A photograph of a young Tokio and Mitsuko is lodged inside. Several days later, Yuna meets Tokio at the venue where she had sat for the national exam for medical practitioners. She is surprised to learn that he is a medical student and develops an interest in him. After that, Yuna finds out that Tokio has, for some reason, been treating patients unable to go to the hospital even though he has no license. He seeks the return of his pocket book and she tells him, “If you want me to give it back to you, come to my house to get it.” When he goes to take his pocket book from Yuna’s home, a party, which has brought her family members, boyfriend Naoki (Ozawa Yukiyoshi) and Honma together, is being held at the residence to celebrate the end of Yuna’s exams. In the midst of this, Yuna’s younger sister, Nagisa (Haru), suddenly collapses … …</Overview>

<Overview>American spy Jack Stiles is sent by Thomas Jefferson to the tiny East Indies island of Palau-Palau where he teams up with British agent and inventor Emilia Rothschild to thwart the efforts of Napoleon and France in that region of the world. While acting as Emilia's man-servant, Jack dons the masked garb of the legendary Daring Dragoon and fights the local French Governor as well as thwarting various other schemes against America. This series starring cult-favorite Bruce Campbell and produced by Sam Raimi combined various factors from both of their series: the use of a historical setting (sorta) and quirky humor that Raimi had made famous with Hercules and Xena, a mix of The Wild Wild West Jules Verne-style tech that was used in Campbell's The Adventures of Brisco County Jr., and the wild stunts that were seen in all of these shows. Airing back to back in syndication with another Raimi production, Cleopatra 2525, Jack... lasted two years.</Overview>

<banner>graphical/77977-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>First season
During the first season, the show centered on the four teenagers as high school students and included guests such as Scott Foley as a college boy Zoe had a crush on, Sara Rue as a wheelchair-using bully, Will Friedle as a charming stoner who dated Zoe, and Jacinda Barrett as a girl who liked both Duncan and Jack.

The first season theme song was "Charmed" by My Friend Steve.

Second season
When the show returned for a second season, it had been heavily retooled. The friendship between the four friends remained intact, but now they were adult college students. Gone was Keller as Zoe's mom, while Omar Gooding joined the cast as the foursome's friend Doug Anderson. The title had also been shortened to simply Zoe... (pronounced on-air as Zoe Dot Dot Dot) out of fear that the former title was turning off potential viewers.

After the series was cancelled, Michael Rosenbaum expressed disappointment with the fact that the network had cut his character's name out of the title for the second season.</Overview>
