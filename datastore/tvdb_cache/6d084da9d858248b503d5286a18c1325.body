  <Overview>When the Philadelphia bank Eileen Townsend works for transfers her to Europe, she takes her sons (teen-age Chris and 10-year-old Max) to stay with her uncle Gustav Helsing.  Gustav's passions in life are schnitzel, polka music and, we will come to find out, hunting Dracula, who is living nearby as businessman Alexander Lucard.  Also living with Gustav is teen-age Sophie Metternich, who impresses Chris.
Max is also obsessed with vampires, and not knowing about Gustav's quest, he misreads several signs and becomes convinced that Gustav is a vampire.  With his mother away on an assignment, Max goes to the only other adult he knows, the businessman his mother had introduced him to at a reception the previous day, Alexander Lucard.
At Lucard's urging, Max lures Chris and Sophie to Lucard's castle.  Upon their arrival, Lucard reveals his true nature.  Max and Chris get away, but Sophie is left in Dracula's clutches. Unable to reach Gustav, Chris and Max return to the castle to rescue Sophie.</Overview>

  <Overview>Gustav and one of his former students, Arthur Bauer, find a rare herb and develop a formula called the quinidrine solution, which they hope will reverse the effects of a vampire's bite. When Arthur is kidnapped, Gustav allows himself to be captured by Lucard so that he can test the solution on himself and Arthur. But the formula doesn't work, because Max has confused it with his high protein energy drink and has consumed all the quinidrine. When the kids arrive to free Gustav, Max is able to fend off Lucard and his lieutenant, Klaus, by firing energy bolts at them through his fingers. They escape back to the house, where the kids quickly use their last remaining quinidrine leaf to mix up another batch of the solution for Gustav and Arthur. Gustav is saved, but Bauer chooses to reamin a vampire. He attacks Gustav, but doesn't know about the Cross of the Magyars, the house's protective talisman...which then destroys him.</Overview>

  <Overview>Max brings home a bungling vampire-hunting scientist, Magnus St. John-Smythe, who insists that a new laser gun he's developed can destroy vampires using concentrated sunlight. Magnus' benefactor in the project, however, is Lucard himself, eager to learn if such a gun is possible. Lucard determines that Magnus' invention is a waste of time and money when it has no effect on a vampire colleague. Incensed, he's about to vampirize Magnus, when Gustav and Max barge in and stop him. Later, at Lucard's castle, the vampire colleague suddenly disintegrates and Lucard becomes the proud owner of the world's only delayed-action vampire gun...which he then destroys.</Overview>

She and her husband Lane at first seem comical, then ominous, as she proceeds to disturb Gustav by sensing personal information about his past. Meanwhile, Max is sure he's discovered the resting place of Dracula and can therefore destroy him. However, the coffin is only a decoy placed there by Lucard and in fact contains not Lucard, but Lane Zorro, nebbish vampire, who is borrowing it. When Lucard confronts the kids and the Zorros, Lana proves she is a real psychic by sending an automatic-handwriting cry for help to Gustav.</Overview>

  <Overview>Lucard invites Mycroft Tickler, a lounge performer with delusions of grandeur, to give a recital at his castle. Gustav tries to warn Tickler, but he's utterly oblivious to anything other than the chance to further his career. However, Lucard actually has no interest whatever in Tickler's &quot;&quot;talents&quot;&quot;--he knows that Tickler is none other than Magnus St. John- Smythe's bother. Lucard has realized that he could use St. John-Smythe's anti-vampire gun in his own defense, so he kidnaps Tickler and sends a ransom note to St. John-Smythe in order to lure him to the castle. As an extra incentive for St. John-Smythe to build another copy of the gun, Lucard captures Gustav and locks him in a shrinking room.</Overview>

  <Overview>Lucard bites a young thief with a rare antigen in his blood which can kill the vampire who ingests it. The famous vampire doctor, Gabor Varney, tells him that there is only one cure--water from the Paquette Spring in the Bettange Valley. Sick and delirious, Lucard doesn't trust anyone, and insists on going to the spring himself. Once there, he discovers that the water has been polluted by one of his own factories. As Lucard lies dying, Gustav and Max arrive to finish him off. Fortunately, Varney stops them and gives Lucard a vial of the water, purified, which returns him to normal. Meanwhile, Sophie is dating a creepy young existentialist poet named Vincent, and Chris is jealous. In fact, Vincent is the thief whom Lucard bit; now a vampire himself, he attacks Chris, who spurns him with a cross but discovers that it's already too late to save Sophie.</Overview>

  <Overview>Gustav's best friend, a fellow vampire hunter named Frederick Rilling, claims that people at his old age home are being killed by a vampire. He asks Gustav to help him destroy the one responsible. Meanwhile, Lucard tries to play Pygmalion to an airheaded Galatea named Amber Santana. Things are not as they seem, however: Amber is in fact a dedicated vampire hunter who hopes to kill Lucard, and Frederick is an ancient vampire who hates what he is but is unable to control himself.</Overview>

  <Overview>Max meets Lawrence Lei, a rather Norman Bates-ish neurotic bookseller who has a peculiar interest in vampires. Gustav doesn't trust him, and Lucard finds him much too bizarre for his taste when he shows up at the castle asking to be made a vampire. Lawrence mentions that his friend Alfred won't make him a vampire either, and Lucard decides to hunt down this Alfred, whom he suspects is responsible for the recent upsurge in the area's population of inferior zombies. When Gustav's hot and steamy schnitzel arrives neither hot nor steamy, delivered by a glassy-eyed delivery boy who is destroyed by the Cross of the Magyars, Gustav tracks his origin back to Alfred as well. However, it turns out that Lawrence's friend Alfred is nothing more than an inflatable vampire doll and that Lawrence is the real vampire. Intrigued by Lawrence/Alfred's split personality, Lucard seals the bookseller in a coffin for safe keeping.</Overview>
