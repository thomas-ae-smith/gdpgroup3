<banner>graphical/73804-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>This series revolved initially around the adventures of two cousins, Ryan Dallion and Micki Foster, who inherited an antique shop, "Curious Goods," from their Uncle Vendredi.  We find out in the first episode that Vendredi made a pact with the Devil, to sell cursed antiques.  He recanted at the last minute and tried to recover the antiques, but was claimed by Hell.  The cousins, aided by Vendredi's partner Jack Marshak, used the store's manifest to track down the cursed antiques, each of which fell into the hands of someone who inevitably used them for evil. In the third season, Ryan was turned into a child and Johnny Ventura, a street punk who had helped them occasionally, took his place.</Overview>

<Overview>Friday Night With Jonathan Ross was a UK chat show broadcast on BBC1 for almost ten years to July 2010.

With a cheeky gag never too far away and a wit sharper than his own suits, guests didn't always get an easy ride on the way to plugging their latest film, book, session in rehab or range of underpants.

Funny, likable , provocative and unlike any other chat show host, anyone getting to sit with Jonathan was either doing something right or Ricky Gervais</Overview>

<SeriesName>Girl Friday</SeriesName>
<Overview>Many people, most people, would baulk at such a challenge. For Joanna Lumley, however, it proved to be an irresistible opportunity. And so, after just one day's survival training with the Irish Guards, she found herself on the proverbial desert island, off Madagascar, left to fend for herself. Girl Friday, her incredible BBC TV Film, is the amazing result of her experiences there. The change of lifestyle could not have been more radical but Joanna adapted with gritty style, building her "A" frame bed, finding fresh water and food and learning to cook on an open fire, while at the same time staving off the intense heat and a myriad of blood-sucking insects. However, Joanna's story is much more than just an account of physical survival. It is a journey of discovery revealing an unknown side to one of Britain's most popular celebrities both to her many admirers and also to Joanna herself. For it is an intimate record of how it feels to live in total solitude. An account of the excitement and the joys, the dislocation and even the insanity of real life in paradise.</Overview>
