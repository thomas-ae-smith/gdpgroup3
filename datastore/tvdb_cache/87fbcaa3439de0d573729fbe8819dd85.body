  <Overview>Sensing Murder is the television series in the United States, broadcasted on the Discovery Channel, in which alleged psychics are asked to act as psychic detectives to help solve famous unsolved murder cases. The psychics have not managed to solve any of the cases, although they have uncovered facts that only police knew about. They have in some cases provided actual names of persons related to the area the crime was committed to police, names of persons confirmed by serving or ex-serving police officers to have existed and resided in close proximity to locations of crimes around the time they were committed.</Overview>

  <Overview>On August 24th 1979, high school sweethearts 17-year-old Mary Leonard and 19-year-old Ricky Beard vanished. Their families never lost hope that they might return, until six years later, when their remains were discovered in a wooded area. An autopsy confirmed that they had been murdered. Police in Akron, Ohio, have investigated the case for 27 years — with no arrests. Now, with the permission of the families, they are calling in two of America's most respected psychics, Pam Coronado and Laurie Campbell. Psychics believe that objects that belonged to the victims — photographs — even visiting the crime scene — retain an energy that allows them to see the crime. Can they use their unique skills to provide new clues? Can they actually sense murder?</Overview>

  <Overview>On July 30, 2003, 22-year-old Angela Lee was beaten and strangled to death in her East Gillespie, Ill., home. Her son, a toddler at the time, was home during the murder. Three years later the police have no concrete leads. And Angela's mother is desperate for answers. Macoupin County Sheriff Don Albrecht and Detective Sergeant Mike Kostich have interviewed hundreds of people in their search for suspects ... but the crime remains unsolved. At the request of Angela's mother, they have now brought in two of America's most experienced psychic investigators, Pam Coronado and Laurie Campbell, to try and help find Angela's killer. Pam and Laurie have no prior knowledge of this case — they know nothing about Angela or how she was murdered — only that they are here to help a murder investigation get on track. Can they actually SENSE murder?</Overview>
