<SeriesName>Destination Fear</SeriesName>
<Overview>In each episode, two unsuspecting guests are given a ticket on a ride they won’t soon forget, by a close friend or relative. These participants think that they’re heading to a spooky destination, from hotels with ghostly pasts to islands infested with goblins. What they don’t know is that they are about to be taken for the paranormal ride of their lives. Each adventure will be meticulously staged to enhance the already scary location and to scare the daylights out of our guests. At the end of the show, we celebrate the experience with each guest, and share with them that someone he or she knows has gifted them the experience. They will be shocked ... amused and of course, a little relieved to have survived!</Overview>

<SeriesName>13 Fear Is Real</SeriesName>
<banner>blank/84468.jpg</banner>
<Overview>"13 – Fear Is Real" is a spine-tingling new 8-part reality series in which the horror genre and reality genre meld to make a new, innovative series. Thirteen people compete to "stay alive" as they face their deepest fears in an all-out elimination competition and scare-fest. Pitted against each other in situations straight from the horror movies, the 13 will face shocking surprises, psychological scares and lots of "beware of the dark" moments, all designed by a "mastermind" of terror. In addition to frightening them, he'll also entice individuals to work in concert with him and against the others, creating a situation in which the 13 will not only look over their shoulders but will also never be certain who is real before them.

Each week, one unlucky victim will be "killed off" via frightening challenges and game-playing until only one person is left to win the grand prize of - fittingly - $66,666.

"13 – Fear Is Real" is produced by Magic Molehill Productions, Inc. and Warner Horizon Television Inc. in association with Jay Bienstock Productions and Ghost House Pictures with executive producers Jay Bienstock ( "Survivor," "The Apprentice" ), Sam Raimi (the "Spider-Man" films, "The Evil Dead" films) &amp; Robert Tapert ( "The Evil Dead" films, "The Grudge" films).</Overview>
