  <Overview>THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, the first documentary series ever to profile all 41 of America's chief executives, will premiere Sunday, April 9, 2000, 9-11 PM (ET) (check local listings) on PBS, with A MATTER OF DESTINY, featuring the programs entitled FAMILY TIES and HAPPENSTANCE. The epic series, ten hours in length, tells the story of the nation from the perspective of the highest office in the land, and features exclusive interviews with President Clinton and all the living former presidents except Ronald Reagan. The programs air in nightly two-hour blocks, concluding on Thursday, April 13.

In a unique casting coup, the series producers have persuaded an extraordinary group of political, military, and media figures to provide voices for the presidents who held office before the development of sound recording. The list includes General Colin Powell, General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, Senator Robert Dole, Walter Cronkite, radio personality Don Imus, former WASHINGTON POST editor Ben Bradlee, Senator John Glenn, James Carville, Andrew Young, and the Reverend Billy Graham.

THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT is narrated by TIME magazine's White House correspondent for four decades, Hugh Sidey. The series benefitted from an illustrious group of presidential scholars, but only one is seen on the screen: Richard E. Neustadt of Harvard University, whom Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. has called &quot;our most brilliant commentator on the presidency.&quot;

&quot;The story of the presidency is history on a scale that is both heroic and personal,&quot; says producer Philip B. Kunhardt III. &quot;These men achieved the highest office in the land -- whether through personal ambition, the turn of events, or sheer happenstance -- and imprinted their images on a chapter of the American story. Many of them were men of extraordinary character and many of them were flawed. One of the most interesting things that emerges when you look at them as individuals is that personal flaws are not necessarily a barrier to greatness, and rigorous personal virtue does not necessarily protect against failure.&quot;

Each of the series' one-hour programs presents the stories of several presidents, linked by a common theme. The first evening's programs, FAMILY TIES and HAPPENSTANCE, for example, are presented under the umbrella title A MATTER OF DESTINY. FAMILY TIES investigates the fact that power and influence, even in a democracy, are handed down from generation to generation in a few privileged families. Profiled are John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy. HAPPENSTANCE explores the careers of five presidents -- John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, and Harry Truman -- who moved from the vice presidency to the White House upon the death of the president.

Following the premiere on Sunday, April 9, POLITICS AND THE PRESIDENCY, featuring AN INDEPENDENT CAST OF MIND and THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN airs April 10. EXECUTIVE VISION, combining THE AMERICAN WAY and THE WORLD STAGE airs April 11. THE CANDIDATE, presenting THE HEROIC POSTURE and COMPROMISE CHOICES airs April 12. The series concludes with AN OFFICE AND ITS POWERS, featuring EXPANDING POWER AND THE BALANCE OF POWER on April 13. THE BALANCE OF POWER includes an exclusive interview with President Clinton.</Overview>

  <Overview>Family Ties:
The last thing that the Founding Fathers envisioned was a hereditary chief executive. After all, they had fought a war in part to rid themselves of a king. Yet power inevitably passes from generation to generation, and several families have returned to the White House as though born to it. The stories of these four men reveal both the blessings and the curses of inherited power. Two of them were ill-at-ease with their lofty legacies and struggled as president, while the remaining two flourished in the exercise of power.

Happenstance:
Nearly one in five American presidents has died in office. The vice presidents who succeeded them were often chosen for the ticket less because they were equal to the most powerful office in the land than because they provided some electoral advantage. What happens when such a man takes office -- frequently facing widespread conviction that he is unworthy of the powers he inherits?</Overview>

  <Overview>An Independent Cast of Minds:
&quot;The American public, from time to time, wishes to see the trustee who looks neither right nor left, but only up to the heavens and down to the work before him,&quot; says presidential scholar Richard Neustadt. But is an independent cast of mind the best approach to the presidency? These four men pursued a course that took little account of political affiliation -- to be presidents, in essence, without being politicians. Taken together, they comprise a cautionary tale -- all had difficult presidencies, and neither of the two who sought a second term was granted one.

The Professional Politician:
We forget that, in our nation's early years, taking part in political affairs was considered a duty and an honor, but not a way of life. It was not long, however, before the professional politicians, and the parties they represented, began to find their way to the White House. While the skills necessary for political success can be helpful to a president, they are not in themselves sufficient to guarantee success in the office. Episode 4 traces the presidencies of four political professionals, one of whom was also a great statesman.

  <Overview>The American Way:
It is often observed that American national identity is less a condition than an idea. No one is better positioned to express that idea than the president. What we have come to refer to as &quot;the vision thing&quot; is an expectation that our presidents will bring to office a particularly strong sense of national mission. The four chronicled here may have understood the special character of America in different ways, but in each case a belief that there was a distinctly American way of doing things guided their decisions.

The World Stage:
The president has no greater responsibility than representing the nation on the world stage. Securing a stable world in which American interests can be asserted and defended has been a basic part of the president's job description from the very beginning of our constitutional history. These four men engaged in this task at critical times in our national history and their achievements on the world stage stand as their most durable legacy.

  <Overview>The Heroic Posture:
From the beginning, the presidential office has beckoned to national heroes renowned for their selfless service to their country. This affinity is especially strong for men of military fame, for the president is formally commander-in-chief as well as symbolically the steward of the national interest. The president-as-national hero exemplifies the value we all place on authenticity in governance. We explore here four personifications of this ideal, suggesting a wide-ranging reality behind an enduring standard.

Compromise Choices:
With the rise of political parties came the dawn of political compromise: nominees who were selected not necessarily because they were the best or most obvious candidates for the presidency, but because they were less offensive to some voters than those who might have been the most apparent choices. Their primary qualification for the office often seemed not to be their positive qualities but their relative lack of negative ones. Two of these men found the presidency beyond their powers, while two proved themselves worthy of having been called to the highest office in the land.</Overview>

  <Overview>Expanding Power:
Though the powers of the presidency have expanded with the growth of the nation, the process has been anything but smooth. The prerogatives of the presidency are uncertain and their assertion is invariably contested. These four presidencies are benchmarks in the development of executive power. We see here the emergence in practice of our modern conception of the executive office, and we take the measure of the men who fought to sustain it.

The Balance of Power:
This final episode examines presidential leadership in an era of an increasingly divided government. The American presidency was conceived as one part of a larger system of institutions, and its effectiveness rests in part upon a good measure of cooperation among the branches. As our constitutional system has developed, however, this cooperation has broken down at crucial junctures. The presidents arrayed in this episode suggest four different conceptions of governance within a constitutionally structured balancing act.
