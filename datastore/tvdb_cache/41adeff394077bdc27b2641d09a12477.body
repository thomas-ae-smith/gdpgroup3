<Overview>The plot revolves around young lovers Lyka Raymundo and Noah Ortega. Lyka is a young woman aspiring to be a fashion designer and works as a fashion assistant in the House of Elle. Her decision to pursue the arts is frowned upon by her Tita Clara Rivero because, according to her, it is not a practical choice.

Noah becomes a second lieutenant of the Philippine Army. During a crucial mission, he saves Don Manolo Sebastian and becomes involved in the battle between the Luna and the Waya.

Lyka's position as fashion assistant to Lady Elle is foreshadowed by the fact that she is believed to be the last hope of her fellow White Wolves (a faction/clan of Filipino werewolves): "Ang Huling Bantay". It is through the House of Elle that Lyka crosses paths with Noah, Lady Elle's bodyguard and driver. Little does she know that he is actually her childhood friend, "Jay-Jay" who she thought was long dead. When Lyka and Noah finally meet and fall in love, something had to tear them apart. Something that Noah can never accept. The blossoming romance between the two is hindered by the presence of Gabrielle Dizon and Anton Rivero. Gabrielle is a deep-penetration agent who attempts to distract Noah while Anton is in love with Lyka and will do anything to prove his love.

There are two opposing groups in the story—the Luna and the Waya. The members of the Luna organization have a grudge against the werewolves while the Waya are the protectors of the Lobo (the werewolves), and they want them to co-exist harmoniously with normal humans.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/97241-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Wolf and Sheepdog, also known as Ralph and Sam, are characters in a series of animated cartoons in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies line of cartoons. They were created by Chuck Jones.

Ralph (named after a Warner Bros. employee) has virtually the same character design as another Chuck Jones character, Wile E. Coyote—brown fur, wiry body, and huge ears, but with a red nose in place of the Coyote's black one; (usually) white eyes instead of Wile E.'s yellow; and, occasionally, a fang protruding from his mouth. He also shares the Coyote's appetite, and persistent use of Acme Corporation products, but he covets sheep instead of road runners and, when he speaks, doesn't have the upper-class accent or the egotistical bearing of the Coyote. Another crucial difference is that of personality: Ralph does not have the fanatical drive of the Coyote in pursuing his prey, preferring to abandon his chase at the end of the working day.

Sam, by contrast, is a large, burly sheepdog with white or tan fur and mop of red hair that usually covers his eyes. He very rarely runs and tends to be sedentary in his movements. He does, however, possess effective strength to incapacitate Ralph with a single punch once he catches him.</Overview>
