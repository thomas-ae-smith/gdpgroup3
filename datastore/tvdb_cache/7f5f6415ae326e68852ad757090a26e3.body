<Overview>I have always thought that this normal peaceful everyday life would go on forever.

---until the day I met with that incident.

Even if I had a fight with her, everything would be fine if I just apologized.

---until she was abducted by a huge red dragon that evening.

And, when I realized it, I was in a weird library. At first, I could not grasp the situation, however, soon I found out that library was a magical library with books which hold everything in the World.

I tried to return to the original World ---where she is in--- however, the World Book I was in was partly destroyed and I could not return. In attempt to protect my own World, to rescue her, I set off on a travel to fix the Book.

<Overview>Detective Jeff Slade teams up with scientist Holly Turner, who's late father has created a time machine that can travel back several hours. Together they solve mysteries using the device. In the beginning of episodes (before they travel back in time), things happen because they DID travel back in time, and they are constantly working to avoid paradoxes. This approach to time-travel is unusual in sci-fi movies, and keeps the plot twisted.</Overview>
