<SeriesName>Crash Test</SeriesName>
<Overview>In Crash Test, two contestants go head-to-head to attempt to crash an event which could be anything from a birthday party to an athletic showcase. Before going in, the contestants are each provided with a list of stunts which can be performed for points. Stunts are divided into point values of 10, 50 and 100 points. Some stunts can be performed for points multiple times, while others, by their nature, can only be performed once. A stunt that is attempted but failed earns no points. Finally, the contestants must remember that if at any time they are caught, they lose 100 points and will be ineligible to do any further stunts. The objective for each event is to outscore the other player. If you do, you continue to return to attempt to crash future events, but if you fail, you are out of the game completely. If two contestants tie, then both get to return to compete again. Additionally, there is one stunt each time called the "Wild Card" - a stunt so ballsy that if a contestant succe</Overview>

<SeriesName>Old Grey Whistle Test</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/74956-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The Old Grey Whistle Test (usually abbreviated to Whistle Test or OGWT) was an influential BBC2 television music show that ran from 1971 to 1987. It took over the BBC2 late night slot from "Disco Two", which had been running since January 1970, while continuing to feature non-chart music. It was devised by BBC producer Rowan Ayers. According to presenter Bob Harris, the programme derived its name from a Tin Pan Alley phrase from years before. When they got the first pressing of a record they would play it to people they called the old greys—doormen in grey suits. The songs they could remember and whistle, having heard it just once or twice, had passed the old grey whistle test.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Baka and Test: Summon The Beasts</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/132961-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The story centers around Akihisa Yoshii, the "baka" of the title. His academy rigidly divides up the student body into classes based on the results of tests. The prodigies are in the A class with reclining seats complete with air conditioning, but Akihisa is in F class, the lowest rung of the school ladder which is furnished only with low, decrepit tables and worn-out straw tatami mats. A girl named Mizuki Himeji is actually one of the smartest girls in Akihisa's sophomore year, but she had a fever on test day and was pigeonholed into the F class. Besides Mizuki (who Akihisa secretly adores), the F class also has Yūji Sakamoto, the class president who has been Akihisa's friend and partner-in-crime since the freshman year.

The school happens to have developed experiments to summon fantasy creatures, and Akihisa decides to rally F class to take on the higher-tiered classes and seize their perks. The F class uses the summoned creatures in an all-out battle for school supremacy.</Overview>
