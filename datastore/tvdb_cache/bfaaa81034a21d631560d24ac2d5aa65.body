<Overview>Welcome to Glory, the Island of Happiness.  Well, that's what the billboard says anyway.  The seemingly idyllic small island town in the Pacific Northwest is a breeding ground for eerie events, bizarre happenings and peculiar inhabitants where truth is often stranger than fiction, and sometimes even deadly. Eddie Cahill plays Mike Dolan, a one-hit-wonder novelist who returns to his Pacific Northwest home town to do some sleuthing into the community's strange goings-on. The latest effort by "Scream" scribe and Dawson's Creek creator Kevin Williamson infuses the tried-and-true mystery-thriller formula with some of the elements that made his horror film a blockbuster---slick visuals, an attractive cast and a self-aware sense of humor.</Overview>

Raynor Sarnac and Cindy Picket as his wife Vanessa and Elisabeth Shue and Gabriel Damon with David Hollander and C Thomas Howell and the late Keenam Wynn as the Sarnac family.  The two hour pilot focuses on the Cuban Missle crisis of 1962.

The premiere was moved up to August 13, 1984 with the pilot unveiled right after ABC'S Olympics coverage.  Call To Glory was an immediate ratings success at the outset; alas ABC'S decision to move away from the historical aspects of the show to concentrate on the soapish goings on with the Sarnac family prompted a severe viewer dropoff. The program was finally cancelled</Overview>
