<Overview>Hard on the heels of his award winning series South, Marcus Lush is now turning his attention to the north.

This 10 episode series will see Marcus traverse the North Island from Auckland to the Far North and Cape Reinga, visiting the Islands of the Gulf, and telling the stories of the great harbours of the Manukau, Hokianga, Kaipara and the Waitemata. In many cases he will be taking the road less travelled, via sand-barge, cement ship, on horseback or small local fishing vessels.

To tell these stories Marcus will seek real grass-roots characters, real people of the land. This is a series where New Zealanders tell the tales of what's gone before, tell their own personal stories and share with the rest of the country their love and passion for the area they call home.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Mr. &amp; Mrs. North</SeriesName>
<Overview>Carried over from the popular radio program, Mr. &amp; Mrs. North was a mystery/suspense show played with light humor.  It featured Jerry North as a book publisher, happily married to his charming housewife, Pamela.  Each half-hour episode concerned itself with a mysterious crime, frequently involving a murder that the Norths stumbled upon and solved before show's end.  The Norths live in New York City's Greenwich Village and often call upon their friend for assistance, Lieutenant Bill Weigand, a homicide detective with the city's police department.   Jerry is considered an intelligent, worldly, capable man whose familiarity with mystery stories should leave him a worthy amateur detective.  Pamela is characterized as a simple-minded, naive wife, like so many other women on TV in the '50s.  She is presented as reasoning illogically, as well as acting plain foolishly.  Sometimes she just doesn't grasp her husband's reasoning or is dismissed for following her own women's intuition.  But</Overview>
