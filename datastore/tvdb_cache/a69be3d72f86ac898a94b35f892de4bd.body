    <Overview>Welcome to the 3-2-1 Classroom Contact guide at TV Tome.
One year before it was removed from PBS, 3-2-1 Contact had some of its most enduring sequences re-edited for classroom use.  The result was 3-2-1 Classroom Contact, a little-known production of the Children's Television Workshop (as it was then called).
Dominating the new series of 30 shows was Stephanie Yu, the only cast holdover from the original 3-2-1 Contact.  She handled most of the links, introduced a great many bits from the old show, and generally acted as &quot;sole survivor&quot; of the legendary science series from the 1980s.
All original airdates listed are based on airings as seen on WVIZ in Cleveland.</Overview>
