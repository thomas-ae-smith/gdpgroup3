<Overview>Welcome to the 3-2-1 Classroom Contact guide at TV Tome.
One year before it was removed from PBS, 3-2-1 Contact had some of its most enduring sequences re-edited for classroom use.  The result was 3-2-1 Classroom Contact, a little-known production of the Children's Television Workshop (as it was then called).
Dominating the new series of 30 shows was Stephanie Yu, the only cast holdover from the original 3-2-1 Contact.  She handled most of the links, introduced a great many bits from the old show, and generally acted as "sole survivor" of the legendary science series from the 1980s.
All original airdates listed are based on airings as seen on WVIZ in Cleveland.</Overview>

<Overview>The product of three years' development, 3-2-1 Contact„¢ (B. 1980 D. 1988) stands as the third-longest-running series ever produced by the Children's Television Workshop (as it was then called).  Its premise was to bring the world of science, and all its excitement, to middle-school students, particularly girls and minorities.  Through seven seasons, various hosts traveled around the world to find science in everything.  Over the years, features such as clever animation, biographies, and the detective series The Bloodhound Gang were included.  Complementing the series for middle-school students and teachers alike was 3-2-1 Contact magazine, edited by Jonathan Rosenbloom. In the first season of 3-2-1 Contact, three hosts  Lisa, Marc, and Trini  met at a regular set, called the "workshop," to discuss their scientific adventures.  It looked every bit the science equivalent of The Electric Company, with loads of animation and regular celebrity segments.</Overview>
