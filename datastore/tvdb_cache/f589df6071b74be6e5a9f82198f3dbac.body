<Overview>Linda Chung (钟嘉欣) and Bosco Wong (黄宗泽) star in upcoming TVB drama, Witness Insecurity (护花危情). Portraying a solitary wealthy heiress, Linda Chung’s perspective in life opens up when she falls in love with police officer, Bosco Wong. However, will Linda Chung’s family’s shady past tear apart the two lovers, when justice clashes with love?

As a Witness Protection Unit (WPU) officer, Hui Wai Sam (Bosco Wong) is assigned to protect Kiu Chi Lam (Linda Chung).  A lone figure who possesses a depressive streak, Chi Lam has few social ties with other people. Chi Lam learns the true meaning of happiness when Wai Sam enters her once solitary world. She even takes the initiative to pursue him!

However, Chi Lam’s father, Kiu Kong San (Paul Chun秦沛) disapproves of his daughter and Wai Sam being romantically involved. Perhaps the reason may be that Wai Sam works for the Police department, which threatens to tear apart Kong San’s wealth and status should his past secrets become unlocked.

Thirty years ago, Kiu Kong San was involved in questionable dealings with Lai Shu Fung (Lee Kwok Lun李国麟). The reemergence of Lai Shu Fung led Wai Sam to eventually discover the wealthy Kiu brothers’ past.</Overview>
