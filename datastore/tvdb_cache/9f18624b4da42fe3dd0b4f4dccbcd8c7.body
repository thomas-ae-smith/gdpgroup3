<Overview>In the far future when the continuity of the history has been lost, it is the world where ruins spread to far away. The sea and the sky have disappeared, and the past scenery exists only in the records excavated in the relic. 

The Bureau of Record Excavation is an organization responsible for this task. Ura works for the 92nd office of the bureau. He is absorbed in various records and the world in the past. Riko keeps a little distance to watch him, and she averts her eyes from the records. 

Everyone in this world knows that to know the past means to know the misery of this world. 

One day, Ura restores a strange video. </Overview>
