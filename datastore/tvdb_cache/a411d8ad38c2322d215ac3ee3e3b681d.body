Inside the cave, Winston finds a sepulcher (a wooden box). He opens the sepulcher and a demon skeleton emerges, which tries to drag Winston back in sepulcher, however, Derek runs in and manages to close the box. The demon is trapped back inside.

  <Overview>Alex has telephoned Derek and Nick and told them where Julia is. They head to the antique store looking for her. Meanwhile, the possessed antique store owner goes to Rachels place. He tells her that he has fixed the box. She opens it and a bright white light emerges, appearing to hypnotise Rachel. The antique owner then turns into Rachels dead husband, Patrick. The two of them proceed to kiss and eventually have sex. However, during sex, he changes back into his original form. Rachel screams and Derek and Nick, who are close by, hear her screams. When Nick bursts in Rachels room, the demon runs, Nick pursues it into a field and kills it. Once the demon is destroyed, Nick glances over to a cross placed in the middle of the field. When he gets closer, he notices that it is Julia on the cross, - dead. Nick breaks down in tears.

His skull is crushed, but not his head, and his body is covered with what looks like electrical burns.    The coroner is an old aquaintence of Dereks and he asks if Derek will come and help. He takes Kristin with him and they find a small town with a deep, dark secret.</Overview>
