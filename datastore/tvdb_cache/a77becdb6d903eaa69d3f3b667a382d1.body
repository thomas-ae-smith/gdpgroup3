  <Overview>Master Ika returns, and sets a bomb trap for Robin and his band. Sir Guy of Gisborne has returned from the crusades purporting to be a changed man, and saves Marion from being injured in a fight: he still loves her, and persues her again. But it was Sir Guy who hired the Japanese assassin to set the trap for Robin. Sir Guy leaves a note for Robin to find, which will lead him into another deadly explosive trap. Marion declares to Guy that she loves Robin, not him, and goes off to follow Robin. Sir Guy realizes that Marion is now going to fall into the trap intended for Robin. So both Guy and Robin have to work together to save her.</Overview>

  <Overview>Lord Cloughton arranges a summit with three important Normans to conspire with the Saxons against King John. Each member of Robin's band undertakes to fetch one of the participants, protecting them from the men of Count Rood, who wants to prevent the meeting: Robin fetches the suspicious and reluctant Countess DuMonde, Marion fetches the agoraphobic young Count Lucerne, and Friar Tuck fetches Count Brouchard (who turns out to be Barkley), while Little John protects Lord Cloughton. Rood hires a mysterious assassin, who can morph into many different people and creatures, to help prevent the meeting.</Overview>
