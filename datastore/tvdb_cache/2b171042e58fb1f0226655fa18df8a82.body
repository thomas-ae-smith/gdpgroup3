<Overview>Based on a shoujo manga by Maki Minami serialised in Hana to Yume.

When Hikari was little, she and her father liked to watch pro wrestling, and she became very good at it. She was the pride of her family until one day she was introduced to Kei, the son of her father's friend. He instantly defeated her in wrestling, and started what would become Hikari's major ambition to one day beat him. To do this she enrolled in Kei's school, an ultra elite school that costs her father a lot of money. This unusual school created classes according to grades, and the top seven students become members of the "SA". They have their own building, and can optionally attend class. Hikari is usually the only one who does so, since she desperately wants to beat Kei with test scores. The members of the "SA" have been close friends since their first year.</Overview>

<Overview>A Bit Of Fry And Laurie was witty and sophisticated entertainment of consistently high quality, with an old-fashioned revue-type atmosphere and oddly 'British' sketches that rejoiced in literary turns of phrase and elaborate wordplay. The delicate innuendos, coupled with Fry's ability to suggest hidden meanings in everyday phrases, gave the impression that bubbling below the innocent surface were lewd undercurrents threatening to burst through, although they never did. To add to this mix, Hugh Laurie demonstrated his keyboard talents with parodies of musical genres.</Overview>

<SeriesName>A Pup Named Scooby-Doo</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/73546-g3.jpg</banner>
<Overview>For more than a decade, it looked as if this would be the final weekly Scooby Doo series.  Following the unsuccessful run of The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, the creators went back to the drawing board and turned the original "Mystery Inc." characters into small children, who now worked under the title of "The Scooby Doo Detective Agency."  Gone were the days of a pup named Scrappy-Doo, this series ushered in the age of a pup named Scooby-Doo!  Although they would have been this age in the '50s or '60s, the kids were far more like kids of the '80s, with computers, skateboards, and gadgets that were popularized far later.  As in the original series, the villains of this series were always bad guys in rubber masks, a concept that they had gotten away from when Scrappy entered the show and the ghosts became real.  More cartoonish than the rest of the shows, the characters seemed to nod back to the old Warner Bros. cartoons -- complete with bugging eyes, gaping jaws, and a myriad of hijinks an</Overview>

<SeriesName>A Man Called Hawk</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/73280-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>A Man Called Hawk is a spin-off of the Robert Urich drama Spenser: For Hire. Hawk, played by Avery Brooks, moves back to his hometown of Washington, D.C. Hawk is tough and streetwise, a man who is erudite with a booming baritone voice who dresses fly while fighting crime -- despite the fact that he lacks the "official" credentials to do so. His mentor and father figure is the "Old Man." Although many critics dismissed Brooks' portrayal in the series as stiff and one-dimensional, Brooks himself described Hawk as "a contemporary, mythological brown hero." Although steeped in mystery, Hawk was clearly very proud of his heritage -- his home was filled with African sculptures and artifacts. We also learn that Hawk is a Vietnam War veteran, a former boxer and is skilled at playing jazz piano. The series premiered in January 1989 as a mid-season replacement. Its ratings suffered and the show was cancelled after just one season.</Overview>

<Overview>Welcome to the A Gentleman's Club guide at TV Tome. There is no editor for this show. If you would like to be the editor look here for details. "The staid, faded elegance of a gentleman's club was the setting for this sitcom from Richard Gordon, creator of the Doctor series of novels, films and TV series. The fictitious Albany club, situated off Pall Mall, 'up steps worn by five generations of gentlemanly leather', was based upon various actual clubs and shared some of the problems of the real-life establishments: lack of funds, grumbling members and a decaying building. A male preserve, the Albany deigned to doff its top hat towards the fairer sex, with mixed 'dinner evenings' (albeit with the ladies segregated in their own dining chamber) and female employees. But this last, progressive move”brought in only after a woman was appointed Prime Minister”continued to raise the hackles of some of the older members, who hadn't absolutely forgiven womankind since Suffragettes smash</Overview>

<Overview>Set in Academy City, a city of scientifically advanced superhuman students, located to the west of Tokyo, in a world where magic is also real. Kamijou Touma's right hand, the Imagine Breaker, can negate all magic, psychic, or divine powers, but not his own bad luck. One day he finds a young girl, Index, hanging on his balcony railing. She turns out to be a nun from the Church of England, and her mind has been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum — all the magical texts the Church has removed from circulation.

You see, Chris, Mary, Nick and little Holly Bankston were recently orphaned, and with no adult to care for them, the courts threatened to split them up and place them in foster homes. Desperate situations call for desperate measures, so the four shrewd kids selected a crusty old homeless person -- Joe -- and turned him into their long-lost "grandfather." In return for food, shelter and clothing, "Grandpa Joe" would agree to keep up the charade and everyone would be happy -- kids, court and Grandpa. But what starts out as a good "deal" quickly turns into more than they all bargained for. The children soon realize they need more strict guidance than they had imaged. Joe discovers that, in addition to adjusting to life</Overview>

<banner>graphical/201661-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>A Quiet Word With is an occasional series of one-on-one conversations between Tony Martin and a high profile entertainer.

Martin has been spouting his nonsense for close to three decades, on TV (The D-Generation, The Late Show), radio (Martin/Molloy, Get This), in books (Lolly Scramble, A Nest of Occasionals), as a stand-up comic, and on his website The Scrivener’s Fancy. Now he has taken up interviewing.

Two chairs, no clips, and work-related talk only. A Quiet Word with… is not a show about people’s marriages, divorces, children and parents. It’s about a rather thin, film and comedy nerd talking shop with someone he admires for 26 minutes. There are some brief opening titles, an irritatingly catchy theme tune and quite nice lighting. Apart from that, it’s just interesting talk, surprising tangents and more than a few cheap laughs.</Overview>

<SeriesName>A Kalahari Family</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/152481-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview> Encapsulating 50 years of Namibian history, A Kalahari Family represents a lifetime of documentation, research, and personal contact with the Ju/'hoansi of Nyae Nyae by filmmaker John Marshall. Through the voices of ≠Oma Tsamkxao and his extended family, viewers learn the extraordinary story of the Ju/'hoansi, beginning with their experiences as independent, self-sufficient hunter-gatherers, continuing through the wrenching changes of dispossession and militarization, and culminating with their attempts to establish viable farming settlements.
   Principally, A Kalahari Family is a story of struggle against the myths and misconceptions that are held about "Bushmen" and the outside economic interests that try to exploit them. Most importantly, the series provides the Ju/'hoansi with an opportunity to speak for themselves and to counter the stereotyped notions of "wild, primitvie Bushmen" with images of the real work Ju/'hoansi are carrying out in Nyae Nyae and the development they have accomplished.
   The series is the product of a fourteen-year collaborative effort involving film and media professionals as well as scholars in the fields of anthropology, history, archaeology and ethnographic film.</Overview>

<SeriesName>A watchdog's Tale</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/155811-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Lai Chun Sing (Kent Cheng) has been in the police force for 30 years. During one investigation, his assistant police dog sacrificed its life to save him. Struck by the death, Sing decided to join the Police Dog Unit. In 25 years, he advanced from a dog caretaker to an instructor and he now plans to use his retirement money to open a dog care center, allowing dog owners to bring their dogs for training and play.

Sing's wife died a long time ago, but left him with an obedient daughter, Lai Sin Yue (Linda Chung). Yue follows after her father and loves animals as if they were human. This eventually leads Yue to become a veterinarian. She later decides to help her dad and moves to the countryside to help with his dog care center. Her determination is driven by the fact that she wants to make sure all animals are treated lovingly.

In the countryside, they soon meet the rowdy bunch that lives there. Chow Yung Kung (Steven Ma) is the renovator who is in charge of preparing the dog care center. Yue and Kung initially start off on the wrong foot, but the two eventually start developing feelings for each other as they spend more time together. They start to fall in love with each other, but Sing refuses to accept Kung as his daughter's boyfriend, saying that Kung has no education, no stable job, and on top of that, is perverted. To make things more complicated, Kung's ex-girlfriend (Queenie Chu) reappears with a vengeance.

The two side stories involve Chiang Tin-Ngo (Maggie Siu), her brother Tin-Hung (Lee Kwok Lun), Chou Ka-Man (Natalie Tong), and Ho Tin-Yau (Raymond Wong). Tin-Hung has always been looked down upon by his father and sister as a failure. He wants to start his own business, but his father will not loan him the money, believing all of his son's ideas are bound to end up a disaster. His sister refuses to help him plead their father, so Tin-Hung resorts to kidnapping Tin-Ngo and demanding their father for a large sum of money.

Tin-Ngo then devotes herself to finding the kidnapper, believing it is someone in the nearby countryside. She monitors all of villagers closely, looking for something suspicious. She even decides to move in to study them closer. Tin-Hung, scared that his sister might figure out the kidnapper was him, moves himself to the countryside too, attempting to prevent Tin-Ngo from getting any serious evidence. While she is there, Tin-Ngo starts to develop feelings for Sing, but she is rejected and runs away.

Meanwhile, Tin-Yau is a striving police officer that wants to do the best he can at his job. Ka-Man has a crush on him, but Tin-Yau refuses to admit his feelings for her. However, the two eventually become a couple. Ka-Man's dad is a drug dealer and is scared that with Tin-Yau always around the house, he'll stumble upon his hidden drugs. Ka-Man's dad tells them to break up, but Ka-Man refuses. Unknown to her, Ka-Man has been hauling around a bowling ball stuffed with crystal meth that she thinks is a present from her dad...

Will Sing learn to accept Kung and Yue? Will Yue and Kung overcome tides of difficulty? Will Tin-Ngo find out who kidnapped her? And will Ka-Man find her birth mother, as well as reconcile with her dad and Tin-Yau?</Overview>
