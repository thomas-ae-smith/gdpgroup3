<Overview>From deep within the historic TV animation vaults comes this nostalgic, hilarious blast from the past: The Garbage Pail Kids television series!
Based on the wildly popular "Garbage Pail Kids" trading card stickers produced by The Topps Company (and coveted by collectors) in the 1980s, these 13 animated TV episodes produced in 1989 have remained unaired and unseen - until now.
Join the adventures of a seemingly normal group of kids who have the ability to quickly "trash out" to their superhero identities to right whatever wrongs come their way. It's a wacky, funny comedy gross-out with all 13 individual episodes of this rare, never-before-seen animated series.</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Adventures of Fat Albert and The Cosby Kids</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/260521-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids was the syndicated version of the animated cartoon originally known as Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. While the original debuted in 1972, the syndicated version began in 1984 and ended in 1985. The show, created by Bill Cosby, used the childhood experiences of Cosby himself as source material for much of the show. The show used a unique presentation of animation and live action to present young viewers an underlying lesson emphasized by Cosby himself at the beginning and end of each episode. Known collectively as the Junkyard Gang, characters included Fat Albert, Mushmouth, Dumb Donald, Bill Cosby, Russel Cosby, Weird Harold, Rudy Davis and Bucky. Each episode presented a common problem or issue and demonstrated ways for young children to deal with them. Subjects ranged from stage fright, being in the hospital and playing hooky from school to more serious topics like smoking, vandalism, stealing, immigration, racism, child abuse, kidnapping, drugs and gun violence. The syndicated version of the show had all original episodes in addition to episodes that were developed from 1984-1985. The lack of network limitations gave producers more freedom to work with more risqu'' topics in the new episodes, including encounters with law enforcement and the prison system.</Overview>

For as long as it ran on PBS, Liberty's Kids entertained seven to twelve-year-olds while introducing them to the exciting stories and people behind the birth of a nation.

The show was based on Cosby's '60s stand up comedy monologues about his childhood.  The episodes revolved around the daily life lessons learned by Albert and his friends.

<Overview>The show was about a group of young people who were members of a band, the Sundance Kids. They had a lot of fans, had records, signed autographs, etc. But the band was just a cover. Actually, the Sundance Kids were undercover members of the CIA. They posed as a band to lift suspicion off of them while they solved the cases assigned to them.  They got their assignments from their 'manager' a branch of the CIA posing as The World Wide Talent Agency. The head of it was the manager, a huge computer called Mr. Socrates, who looked and sounded like HAL from '2001, A Space Oddessy', and who would contact the Sundance Kids va Butch's radio ring whenever he had an assignment for them. He would line up a gig for them so no one would wonder why musicians were there while they solved the case. There was at least one song in every episode. The characters: BUTCH CASSIDY (seriously!): The Designated leader of the Kids. He plays Lead Guitar and is the Lead Singer of the group. Unlike Fr</Overview>

<Overview>The Flintstone Kids was one of the many Flintstones spin-offs. It featured our main characters except as 10 year olds. Along with some new characters: Dreamchip, Philo, and Rocky Ratrock these mischevious kids got in many adventures. This show was great and one of the best cartoons of the 80's. Although it didn't match up to the original grown-up versions of The Flintstones it still carried on from 1986-1988. The series ended with a bang with the populated feature special in 1988 "The Flintstone Kids Just Say No". There were other segments that featured along with the show. One was called "Dino's Dilemma", and the other was called "Captain Caveman". Those two segments were featured after Flintstone Kids episodes were finished and eventually Captain Caveman became a spin-off. Basically all these things are what made The Flintstone Kids a great show and an excellent addition to The Flintstone</Overview>

<Overview>Richie Adler (Matthew Laborteaux) lives with his mother and sister; his parents are divorced, and his father works overseas, often in the Middle East, as a telecommunications engineer/consultant[1] to several firms located there. Richie is an advanced computer user with cutting edge skills. Presumably he has inherited these abilities as well as most of his computer equipment from his father.[2] He acquires obsolete equipment that was scheduled to be scrapped and sends it to Richie. He even sends a programmable robot, Herman.[3] Richie collects this equipment and connects and assembles it to form RALF, his pet name for his computer system. RALF has multiple components and capabilities, including a camera which produces a primitive facial identification system.[4]

Richie and his friends come across mysteries which they (mainly Richie) attempt to solve using his computer skills with RALF's power. Guidance is often provided by newspaper reporter Farley (their mentor). The cases often involved money-hungry criminals working inside business or government who would assault and murder people to cover-up their deeds. There were also a few episodes involving spies of the Soviet Union.

Lew Farley (Max Gail) is a reporter for the fictional newspaper the LA Gazette (although on the first episode the reporter is named Gallagher and he is played by Michael Horton). Many of his stories are exposés of crime and corruption. He is well connected and seems to know everyone from gangsters to beat cops to a mysterious patriarch.[5] He has a cantankerous but mutually beneficial relationship with Lieutenant Quinn (A Martinez) who is head of the detective unit, and also married to Farley's sister.[6] Farley was a Vietnam-era anti-war protester who was jailed and beaten on occasion during marches.[7] He was inspired to journalism by a woman whose death he investigates in "The Wrong Mr. Wright".

Farley is somewhat technologically capable (carrying around one of the first laptops ever sold, a Gavilan SC),[8] but he relies on Richie for complicated technical help. He warns the Whiz Kids of danger and helps them when they get in over their heads with criminal elements or with the government. He is often the first person they call when they are trouble, and Richie's mother leans on him as well.[2]

In most episodes, the three groups — the police (mostly led by Quinn), the media (usually Farley), and the Whiz Kids — wind up all contributing to cracking a case and in bringing the criminals to justice. Their relationship is often conflicted, as Quinn must keep Farley from getting too much insider information, while Farley and Quinn must keep the kids out of danger. However, each case is never solved by one group alone, and they are all usually forced by circumstance to work together, each drawing on their own particular strengths.

Richie's father is a telecommunications engineer who often works abroad and is mostly absent. He does drop in town occasionally, however.[2] He is well connected in high level Washington political circles, something that Richie's mother alludes to and uses. Richie's mother and father are divorced, but their relationship is portrayed as still positive and friendly.[2] She also keeps his name and refers to herself as Mrs. Adler. She says that she thinks his job-required traveling is what led to their divorce.[1]

Richie's mother is somewhat strict and does not allow his genius level abilities to influence her duty as a mother. She makes him clean up the messes he and his buddies cause with their various hijinks, and she does not let him shirk his schoolwork, chores, or other responsibilities. (Nor does his teacher: in "Red Star Rising", their being applauded by the CIA does not get three of them off the hook for not completing a homework assignment - Alice is spared, since she actually did it!) Richie's little sister Cheryl provides comic relief in most episodes, but she does have a few important scenes of insight or family drama.

There is a slight love triangle between Richie, Ham, and Alice. Alice is a bit of a hacker herself,[9] but she receives little respect or extra attention from Richie, which bothers her greatly. Ham really likes Alice,[10] but she (for the most part) does not return his attentions.

On the whole, the teens do not get a whole lot of character development. Most of the episode time is taken dealing with the complicated plots, criminals exposition, Lew and Quinn, chase scenes, and hacking scenes (which are almost totally focused on Richie). However Jeremy is shown to be rather clever in his own right[11] and the kids are involved in many activities, including go-kart racing, sports, ballet, and music. There is also a bit of a conflict between Richie and the others, as he can sometimes be domineering[12] or arrogant,[13] although they typically reconcile.

<SeriesName>Who's Watching the Kids</SeriesName>
<Overview>This sitcoms was less than successful--not only for its twisted plot outline, but for its crazy characters. Who's Watching the Kids? was a fun, kids sitcom--set in Las Vegas, Nevada--about two kids... Frankie Vitola (15) and Melissa Turner (9), who lived with their two young adult sisters, who worked both as night parents, and as daytime showgirls at the third-rate local nightspot, Club Sand Pile.
Angie was Frankie's sister, and Stacy was Melissa's. Since the girls could basically be tending to their siblings at night, their neighbor, Larry, worked at KVGS as a news anchorman--was asked to please "watch the kids" during the daytime. Mitzi, the emcee at the club, was also the landlord of everyone. Bert Gunkel was Larry's clutsy cameraman, whom also lived in the apartment building and helped Larry watch the kids, and Memphis was the main attraction of Club Sand Pile.</Overview>

<banner>text/75303.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Get ready for sketch comedy...Canadian style! The Kids In The Hall are a hilarious sketch comedy troupe.  They got their name from a comedian named Jack Benny, who would often end a joke by saying: "I got this from the kids in the hall", referring to the amateur comedians who would hang around outside his office.  KITH was formed in 1984 when McCulloch and McKinney, who had worked together in Calgary as part of a group named the Audience, teamed up with Foley and McDonald's Toronto-based group, KITH. Thompson officially joined in January 1985.  That same year, McCulloch and McKinney were hired as writers for NBC's Saturday Night Live after a talent scout saw KITH in performance. Significantly, SNL had also been created by Michaels, himself an ex-patriate Canadian living and producing in New York. Still in 1985, Foley appeared in the film High Stakes, and Thompson and McDonald toured with Second City. In 1986, KITH were reunited in Toronto and Michaels finally saw them perform</Overview>

<Overview>Coming from across the US to New York City -- some to study, others to start their entertainment careers in earnest -- the Kids would eventually meet each other and realize they all shared a dream-to become the sketch comedy players of their generation. 

Together, they began to create sketch comedy that pushed the envelope right off the table, first on the stage of Pianos in NYC's Lower East Side, and now on ifc.com and on the Channel. 

With such YouTube instant classics as "Slow Jerkin" and "Hitler Rap", the Whitest Kids U'Know are doing things that other sketch comedy shows, like Saturday Night Live and MadTV, can't even imagine doing. In other words, the Kids think that both the SNL crew and the MadTV guys are about as funny as finding a new mole on your chest after a summer spent life guarding. In short, those other shows are punk-ass and weak

<banner>graphical/82476-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>On the heels of the extremely successful inaugural season of the A&amp;E series "Paranormal State," the network will premiere "Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal" on Monday, June 16th 10:00PM ET/9C. When your child comes to you and says, "I see dead people." What do you do with that information? There are parents who are scared and isolated with problems that they often keep quiet - issues dealing with their children's paranormal abilities. Now, thanks to Medium Chip Coffey and renowned psychologist and Columbia University professor, Dr. Lisa Miller, help is on the way. Each one-hour episode features three kids who ultimately are brought together by Chip and Lisa to learn how to cope with their gifts and to realize they are not alone. 

Medium Chip Coffey utilizes both his abilities in the paranormal and his Masters Degree in Psychology when he deals with children who are showing signs of possessing psychic and medium abilities. Chip aims to help the children with the supernatural phenomenon he or she is experiencing: how to manage this lifelong "gift" and the burdens that sometimes go along with the paranormal abilities. Dr. Lisa helps the children and families deal with the inter-family conflict they may be experiencing.

From seeing dead people to frightening abilities to predict the future, Chip and Lisa will uncover the truths and help the terrified and gifted. In the end, "Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal," is an intense journey of a medium and a psychologist, who draw on their own personal experiences, training, and unique outlook on life to teach troubled kids how to deal with what they often feel is a curse, as much as a unique and special gift.
