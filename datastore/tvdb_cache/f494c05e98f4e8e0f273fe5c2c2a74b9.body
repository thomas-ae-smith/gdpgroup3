  <Overview>Professor Esal talks to the other teachers at Kazalm about reporting to the palace of Erin's ability to communicate with Lilan with a harp, and not a mute whistle (It is considered against the law to not carry and use one as a beastinarian) and how she is able to become close to an Ohju. Esal tells the other teachers how she and Tomura also tried to use the harp to communicate with Lilan, but Lilan would just stare. Esal comes to the conclusion that the reason Lilan only reacts to Erin is because Lilan sees her as her mother. According to legends, only the Shin-Oh could command the Ohju. However, Erin can also do the same thing. Esal believes that if they report this to the palace, others would believe that Erin was able to command Lilan by using a magic trick of the Mist People, and not because of her own efforts. Also, she believes that the palace would use Erin's ability to communicate with the Ohju for war purposes. The teachers of Kazalm decide to keep Erin and the harp under wraps, and everyone in Kazalm makes an oath to protect Erin and Lilan.</Overview>

  <Overview>Erin noticed Lilan was scratching herself against a tree trunk and thought of using a brush to groom her. She got the brothers, Mok and Nuk, to make her a bigger brush as the small brush was not efficient at grooming. However, while using the bigger brush, she accidentally hurt Lilan. Lilan was infuriated and injured Erin. Thereafter, Erin was told by Esal that the only reason Lilan is obedient to Erin is because Lilan is afraid of Erin. Erin becomes afraid to get near to Lilan due to the incident. However when the memories of the times she spent with Lilan came into her mind, she took up the courage and once again got close to Lilan.</Overview>

He tells her the story of the Touda-breeding country Ophalon and why Ophalon was destroyed at its zenith.

However the Ohju become drunk on blood and they attack the town and people into a wasteland. Afterwards, Je leaves the Ephon Noha region and descends from the sky into this world(before Ryoza). The people there make Je the first Queen of the Holy Kingdom of Ryoza. Erin promises to never stop Lilan from flying and to never tie her down with codes. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Shin-Oh is knocked unconscious after the sudden Tohda attack on the boat-ride to the palace, and stays at Lord Kazalm's home until she recovers. Ia-lu feels ashamed of not protecting her Majesty, and awaits his punishment. Erin sees the aftermath of the attack, and decides to calm the worried men by playing &quot;Birds of Dawn&quot; on her harp. Ia-lu recognizes the song and finds Erin playing it. Erin tends to Ia-lu's wound from the Tohda, and she and Ia-lu talk. Erin tells Ia-lu that the Tohda attacking the ship weren't the Grand Duke's because they didn't have a mark on their tails. Erin then reveals to Ia-lu that she is a Wajyaku, and is from a Tohda breeding village. Throughout the night she tells him about her life; her home village, her mother, and how she ended up in the Shin-Oh Region. The next morning, Erin leaves for the school and Ia-lu promises her that he will keep her story a secret until the time is ready. </Overview>
