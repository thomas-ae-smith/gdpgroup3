  <Overview>This series revolved initially around the adventures of two cousins, Ryan Dallion and Micki Foster, who inherited an antique shop, &quot;Curious Goods,&quot; from their Uncle Vendredi.  We find out in the first episode that Vendredi made a pact with the Devil, to sell cursed antiques.  He recanted at the last minute and tried to recover the antiques, but was claimed by Hell.  The cousins, aided by Vendredi's partner Jack Marshak, used the store's manifest to track down the cursed antiques, each of which fell into the hands of someone who inevitably used them for evil. In the third season, Ryan was turned into a child and Johnny Ventura, a street punk who had helped them occasionally, took his place.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the opening segment (to be repeated throughout the first two years), we see Lewis Vendredi try to recover the cursed antiques, and end up condemned to hell. Distant cousins Ryan Dallion and Micki Foster find out they have inherited an antique shop from Uncle Lewis. Micki wants to simply sell off the place, and Ryan reluctantly agrees. They sell off the antiques in the store, but then are greeted by Jack Marshak, Vendredi's partner and procurer. They find out about Vendredi's deal with the devil, and realize that some of the antiques they sold were also cursed. The first antique they recover, a toy doll, comes to life and kills for its owner, a young girl. They recover the doll, and vow to recover the other antiques as well.</Overview>

  <Overview>A cursed broach possesses several strange abilities, including the ability to transform its wearer into a vampire and the ability to, when daubed with blood, let its wearer travel through time. Micki and Ryan find that the broach's owner, a female vampire, is trying to transform her new male tenant into a vampire. They manage to kill the female, but the transformed tenant, Frank, uses the broach to travel back into time to London in the late 19th century. Micki and Ryan managed to follow him. Befriended by a destitute writer, Abraham, and his fiancee, they manage to track down the vampire and kill him, but not before Abraham's fiancee is killed. They return to their own time, and Jack can only speculate that &quot;&quot;Abraham&quot;&quot; may have been Bram Stoker.</Overview>

  <Overview>Winston Knight, a TV anchorman, gains great fame because a serial killer, the Machete Killer, will only contact him. What no one knows is that Knight is using a cursed camera that lets him create an exact duplicate of himself that goes out and kills for him, providing him with an ironclad alibi and great ratings. As long as he destroys the negative within the allotted time, Knight is fine. Unfortunately, Ryan's new girlfriend Cathy witnesses one of the murders and realizes Knight is somehow the Machete Killer. One of Knight's photo-duplicates kills her, but the trio are close on Knight's trail. Knight eventually fails to destroy one of his indestructible duplicates in time, and disintegrates. However, the duplicate has little time to savor its new life before it dies of previously inflicted wounds.</Overview>

  <Overview>A demented bee keeper, McCabe, uses a cursed antique beehive in a complicated scheme. First he turns loose the bees in the beehive, which kill someone and make a blood-honey. Then McCabe sells the honey to dying businessmen in return for lots of money. The businessmen must then kill their &quot;&quot;replacement&quot;&quot;, and they take over their victims' bodies, abandoning their old lives. However, they have to keep eating the blood-honey (and paying McCabe more money) to maintain the bodies' health, or they revert back to their original dying infirmity. The trio get wind of the scheme, and kill McCabe with the help of one of the businessmen who finds that his new life isn't worth the loss of his loving, abandoned wife.</Overview>

  <Overview>A close-knit family, the Cassidys, had a daughter who was kidnapped by a cult of demon worshippers. They used her to summon a demon. The daughter escaped, and now the family huts the demon. The cult was connected with Lewis Vendredi, and used a secret cavern beneath Curious Goods for their rituals. The paths of the Cassidys and our intrepid trio cross when they track the demon to the store. The demon must be killed by midnight on a particular day, or it will remain on Earth forever. Ultimately, the demon is destroyed and the trio use the expanded space from the cavern to store more antiques, as the Vault was filling up.</Overview>

  <Overview>While mourning the death of his father (in last season's The Prisoner), Johnny catches wind of a series of murders with the victims bearing the mark of a ram's head on their forehead. It turns out that two crooked cops have recovered the Coin of Ziocles (from Tails I Live, Heads You Die). In a shootout, one of them is killed along with a drug dealer they were in cahoots with. The other, live cop figures out the coin can resurrect the dead, and uses it to resurrect his partner as a semi-zombie. They then use the Coin to kill a prostitute, but Johnny grabs the coin from them...and uses it to resurrect his father. Meanwhile, Micki is in a near-useless state, since she herself was briefly dead, killed by the Coin earlier. She doesn't want to go through that again. Disgusted with Johnny's selfish use of the coin, Jack kicks him out, but Johnny manages to redeem himself after the cops get the coin back and try to resurrect the drug dealer to find out where their money is. Johnny saves Micki,</Overview>

  <Overview>Johnny inadvertently screws up when he sells a box of junk to a retarded neighbor without checking the Manifest. A cursed antique car radio is among the items sold. The retarded man's brother, a car repairman and a racist, discovers that the radio can be used to travel back in time when smeared with a murdered victim's blood. He plans to travel back to the 50's in the South and prevent his father from being arrested and killed on murder charges, by killing the black lawyer his father tried to kill. Johnny and Jack, holding on to the car during the racist's second trip, travel back in time with him and manage to stop him.

  <Overview>Desmond Williams, a director, is obsessed with the role that his now-aged actress-wife played 50 years ago: that of femme fatale Lili Lita in a film-noir crime film. He finds a cursed reel that lets him bring the Lili character to life, by pushing an innocent female victim into the film itself while its playing. The victim is forced to relive the entire movie...which ends with the character they are stuck as being killed. Meanwhile, the movie version of Lili emerges into the real-world for the same period of time. To stay alive, Lili must convince Desmond to kill her aged real-life counterpart. The character is also increasingly dissatisfied with her limited &quot;&quot;life&quot;&quot; as a sex toy for Desmond. Ultimately, the aged actress shoots her husband when she finds out what is going on, and decides to enter into the film (replacing a trapped Micki) so she can have her youth back. Trapped with nowhere to go when the film ends, the film Lili is destroyed for good.</Overview>

  <Overview>A famous author of real-life biographies of serial killers, famed for his insights, owes his success to an antique pen. He writes out his story of a serial killer's murders, then uses the pen to &quot;&quot;inject&quot;&quot; them with the story. The curse then turns the victim into a serial killer controlled by the story and forced to go out and kill. Eventually they are captured and then the author extracts the evil just as they are executed, leaving them confused and then dead. Micki becomes the author's next victim. Fortunately, Jack and Johnny stop her before she can kill anyone other than the author himself.</Overview>

  <Overview>A lonely, somewhat twisted mortician stumbles upon the cursed properties of an antique embalmers' aspirator. He can use it to kill one person, to resurrect another without memory. He kills someone with it and then uses it to resurrect a young woman he has fallen in love with. Unfortunately, the woman's husband begins to suspect, and the resurrected woman starts to remember her past life. Ultimately the mortician is killed after he starts a fire, and the women decide to remain in the fire and die again, leaving the trio to recover the indestructible antique from the ashes.</Overview>

  <Overview>Micki, Johnny, and Jack are taking a break, and star-gazing in Jack's old hometown. However, a ghostly biker gang, the Midnight Riders, rolls into town. At the same time, Jack's father Cawley, who has been gone for ten years, also shows up. The gang is out for revenge, as they were falsely accused of raping a girl who lied to protect her reputation and explain the fact she was pregnant. Jack's father was one of the ones who killed the gang and hid the secret. It turns out that Jack's father is also a ghost: he died at sea, but has returned on the anniversary of the gang's death. The girl and the others who participated in the gang's death are killed, and after a brief reunion with his son, Cawley's ghost disappears as well.</Overview>

  <Overview>In this unusual episode, none of the main characters appear except Micki very briefly at the beginning and end. A newspaper columnist accidentally hits a young girl who was wearing a cursed cameo. The silhouette starts harping at him in the young girl's voice to free her by killing someone else. The columnist then kills his ambitious, obsessive mother which frees the girl...but then the mother's voice starts haunting him. He kills a homeless man to bring her back to life, but then is haunted by that man's voice. Ultimately the columnist tries to reverse the curse by killing his mother and then the girl again, and ends up killing himself. At the end, a social worker stumbles across the locket and turns it over to Micki.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the first few minutes, Micki and Johnny recover a yin-yang amulet that lets the user switch bodies after killing someone. They steal it from a wife and her lover trying to kill her husband, and manage to escape. But, on the way back they run out of gas and stumble on a home lived in by two brothers. The brothers are psychopaths who have stuffed their family to keep around the house, and they want Micki. Johnny breaks his leg, but uses the amulet to switch places with the younger brother. He eventually convinces Micki of who he is, and they eventually manage to restore Johnny to his original body. The younger brother is killed, and the other dying brother uses the amulet to inhabit the stuffed body of one of his family members. However, Micki and Johnny manage to puncture enough holes in the animated body that all the stuffing is blown out by the high winds of a storm.</Overview>

  <Overview>A friend of Micki's, who works at a pool club, is drowned by two intruders. The widow inadvertently gives her daughter a jack-in-the-box from a sailor's museum, and the girl discovers that if she kills people with it, she can summon back the ghost of her father for a little while. When the jack-in-the-box opens, the victim is grabbed by a water spirit from a nearby source of water and drowned. The ghostly father isn't happy with his daughter's methods, but the girl's grieving mother has turned to alcohol. Eventually the ghost contacts Micki, who manages to show up in time to stop the girl from killing herself so that she can be with her father forever. Micki recovers the antique and the girl and her mother try to work things out.</Overview>

  <Overview>A psychic medium is dying of a rare degenerative disease. She stumbles upon a cursed television set, which allows her to put her customers in contact with the spirits of their dearly departed. Besides being paid a hefty fee for these real manifestations, she also gets a temporary 10-day extension of her life. The curse later sends the same spirits, horribly twisted and vengeful, after their &quot;&quot;loved one&quot;&quot; and kill them.  The trio notice the pattern of deaths and a friend of Jack's tries to debunk the medium's powers. Eventually he commits suicide rather then let the spirits claim him, and the failure to follow through means the medium dies too.</Overview>

  <Overview>An exclusive fertility clinic is much mroe than it seems. It is run by a cult of female Druids who use a cursed fertility statue to expand their numbers. When infertile couples come to them, they use a ritual that kills the husband and results in the birth of twins: a boy and a girl. They only tell the mother that one child was born, and turn over the boy. They keep the girl to raise as a Druid priestess. A friend of Micki's is undergoing treatment, leading the trio to the clinic. They manage to break up the statue before the Druid priestesses can use a ritual to cause the fertility statue to replicate. The head Druids die, and the trio manage to reunite the young girls with their true mothers.</Overview>
