  <Overview>A television series based on the movie of the same title wherein the entire planet is devastated by a nuclear holocaust and in the 23rd century various societies sprout everywhere and are totally oblivious of each other. One of these communities is the City of Domes wherein the citizens live in total bliss but because of limited space and resources, everyone who reaches the age of 30 is executed in an event called Carousel wherein they are told that they might be renewed in a new form. Now there are dissidents who don't believe the tales of the outside still uninhabitable because of the nuclear radiation. And they also believe of a place called Sanctuary where they can live in peace. These individuals are called Runners and they are hunted by men called Sandmen. One of these men is Logan, who questions whether being renewed actually happens and if the outside is uninhabitable. When he is sent to track down some runners, one of them Jessica who knows about Logan's doubts fuels them with what she knows and Logan decides to join her and they leave the city and search for Sanctuary. Francis, Logan's partner is tasked with trying to find him. Along the way they meet Rem an android, who helps them find their way and teach about the world they have entered.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Earth has been ruined by something in the distant past-- war, plague, ecological disaster, it is never revealed. The remains of humanity have lived within a sealed, domed city, unaware of the condition of the outside or the origin of their own living conditions; to them, the city is and always has been the entire world.

To maintain the internal balance of the city, both reproduction and death are carefully controlled by a monolithic master computer. The only sex is loveless and nymphomaniacal; there are no relationships, no wives or husbands, only &quot;the circuit&quot; where you can obtain a temporary sex partner, as well as orgy rooms, filled with clouds of narcotic gas. Babies are born in glass boxes; the palm of their hand is implanted with a &quot;life clock,&quot; a penny-sized lamp that looks like a crystal. At age 30, the life clock flashes red, and the bearer must report for a ceremony where he is told he is &quot;renewed&quot; but is in fact incinerated. Those who wish to avoid the 30-year-limit must become what is called a &quot;runner.&quot; Runners are considered criminals, and hunted by policemen known as &quot;sandmen.&quot;</Overview>
