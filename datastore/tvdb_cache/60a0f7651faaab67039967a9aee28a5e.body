    <Overview>From deep within the historic TV animation vaults comes this nostalgic, hilarious blast from the past: The Garbage Pail Kids television series!
Based on the wildly popular &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; trading card stickers produced by The Topps Company (and coveted by collectors) in the 1980s, these 13 animated TV episodes produced in 1989 have remained unaired and unseen - until now.
Join the adventures of a seemingly normal group of kids who have the ability to quickly &quot;trash out&quot; to their superhero identities to right whatever wrongs come their way. It's a wacky, funny comedy gross-out with all 13 individual episodes of this rare, never-before-seen animated series.</Overview>
