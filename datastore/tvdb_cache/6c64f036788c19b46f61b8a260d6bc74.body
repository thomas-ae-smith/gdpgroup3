  <Overview>After finishing their Christmas Dinner the Harpers decide to relax and laugh at the misery Nick is apparently having in a jungle without food and water (and naturally needs money). Janey then comes home with her new fiancÃ½, Ches, (played by Danny Webb) who turns out to be a shock - older than Ben!
Both Janey and Ches plan the wedding and Ben is upset that Janey no longer requires his money but he still has to do a Father of the Bride speech while Susan is trying to plan everything (and stop the wedding at the same time).
Meanwhile Michael is having Girlfriend troubles and initially tries to stop her comming to the wedding but after seeing what fun it would be (and he doesn't want to be Janey's page boy) he invites Molly (played by Verity-Jane Dearsley) along to see the 'fun' (and hopes she'll break up with him).</Overview>

  <Overview>Roger is full of Christmas cheer, but as you might expect, Ben isn't. In fact his only Christmas tradition is being grumpy throughout the yuletide period.

This year he is particularly irritable because his house is full of people: clowns are auditioning for Kenzo's birthday party on Christmas Eve, Susan's mother is staying, and Nick's friend Alfie has arrived on the doorstep carrying a guitar and a bag of Nick's crusty old socks.

Ben discovers a very expensive ring in Susan's cupboard, which he assumes is for him, despite them agreeing they weren't &quot;doing&quot; presents this year. He panics because all he's got her is an ironing board cover.

Susan seizes Kenzo's birthday party as an opportunity to determine who his father is, and insists that Janey invite him. Janey gets round this by arranging for three respectable male friends to attend. This momentarily seems like defeat for Susan, until she enlists the help of Michael and his home DNA testing kit...

At Kenzo's birthday party, the increasingly dependable Alfie entertains the children with some songs, while 'behind the scenes' Ben struggles to slap some sense back into Roger. As part of Ben's cost-cutting plan, Roger, a self-professed clown enthusiast, has agreed to pose as 'Shingles' the clown instead of hiring the real thing. Unfortunately he has stage fright and then faints after Ben feeds him too much alcohol to calm his nerves.

Drastic measures are required, and so Ben - whose face is already red from a disastrous facial delivered at Abi's department store makeup counter - adopts the clown costume, and Susan becomes his assistant. They almost get away with it.

Ben only went through Abi's beauty routine in order to use her staff discount card to buy Susan an expensive gift: a video camera. But to his dismay, this is precisely the present that his mother in law has got her. He turns to Alfie, who recommends he buy Susan a first edition book by her favourite author.

So Ben buys Susan a gift of equivalent value to the ring he think she's got him - but of course it turns out to be a present from Susan's mother to her three-months-younger 'toyboy'. Susan is very happy. She's less happy when the DNA tests show that none of Janey's guests were Kenzo's father - but she can't win them all.

She takes pity on Alfie and invites him to stay in Nick's old room.</Overview>

  <Overview>Ben thinks all his Christmases have come at once, when Susan declares that this year there will be no tree, no decorations and most importantly no family.

Susan whisks Ben away to a relaxing country retreat where the rest of the family can't ruin his festivity free day.

With the rest of the family at a safe distance away, Ben settles into the hotel and begins the relaxing Christmas he's always dreamed of.

His fantasy, however, is shattered when the family arrive to surprise him, bringing with them his crazed stalker, Crystal...
 
Abi has just qualified as a massage therapist and decides to pay for her and Roger's room by working in the hotel spa. When she turns up for an appointment, she is horrified to discover who is lying on her table – with little more than a towel covering his modesty.
 
Nick's friend Alfie, meanwhile, is in charge of &quot;babysitting&quot; his Uncle, who has a habit of wandering off, it's not long before Alfie despairs and turns up at the hotel for support.
 
Despite Susan's insistence on making it a &quot;family&quot; only Christmas, Michael manages to smuggle his new girlfriend into his room and Janey surprises everyone by introducing a new addition to the family.
 
With the Harpers all under one roof, will Ben or Susan manage to have the Christmas they dreamt of – especially when Crystal's angry, jailbird boyfriend turns up?</Overview>

  <Overview>It's December 2039 and the Harpers gather together to celebrate Christmas. Thirty years in the future, the family's appearance may have changed somewhat but their love/hate relationships are still very much alive. Ben is in now in his eighties, a little slower than he used to be but still as grumpy as ever and causing grief for Susan – who, thanks to &quot;a little moisturiser&quot;, hasn't aged a bit (&quot;a little moisturiser&quot; may also be an injoke to her guest appearance in Doctor Who). To say that Janey has gained a little weight is an understatement, as she now weighs in at a whopping 20 stone. Michael, meanwhile, is doing a very bad job of hiding his baldness with an unconvincing wig and, following a disastrous trip to the zoo, Roger is now merely a head in a glass dome. Susan is put out by the fact that grandson Kenzo, now 38 years old, hasn't come to visit the family for Christmas Day. Ben is quick to point out that the Harpers have had some of the worst Christmases ever, and the family are reminded of some of their Christmas disasters. Two years stand out in particular – back when they were all a lot younger, and Janey was a lot lighter, the usual arguments over presents were exacerbated by Susan's fun, new game – the Greed Gift Exchange. But, when Kenzo finally arrives, he points out that the year Uncle Richard came to stay was just as traumatic for him. </Overview>

  <Overview>Ben is annoyed to learn that both Janey and Susan are patients of another dentist...especially since Janey has a crush on this dentist. Nick uses Ben's laptop to have an 'email romance' with Isabelle - a famous model...Who's lying to who...?

Recap:

At breakfast time, Nick asks Ben if he can borrow his laptop, which will allow him to start an e-mail relationship with a girl. Ben has forgotten that he is supposed to go out with Susan tonight, and has instead arranged to see a patient.

Janey tells her dad she has an appointment with another dentist, and later at the surgery Brigitte says it's a disgrace that Ben can't make time for his children.

Later Janey is admiring her teeth in the mirror while Nick makes e-mail contact with 'Isabelle'. Isabelle has told him she's a model, but Janey is sceptical.

Michael arrives home with a new pet rabbit. When the family sit down to eat, Janey tells them about Mel, her new dentist.

That night in bed, Ben tells Susan he's worried about Janey's apparent crush on Mel. But when he kisses Susan, he notices that she has had a filling repaired, and is furious when he discovers that she has also been seeing Mel. He goes downstairs and pours his heart out to the rabbit.

The next morning at breakfast, Nick brings in a photo of Isabelle - she is also in last month's copy of Vogue. They do not believe that Nick's 'email friend' is really the girl in the photo. Nick reckons the rabbit is evil.

Michael tells Ben that 'Surfing Mel' has his own website. When Susan's filling falls out, Ben, still offended, says Surfing Mel can fix his own faulty handiwork. At the surgery, Brigitte says Ben is the last to know that his wife is seeing another dentist.

That night Ben comes down and tells Nick to get off the laptop. Nick bets Ben fifty quid that Isabelle is the girl from the magazine, and says that she's coming over. Ben gets Nick to help him to find Surfing Mel's homepage, and then Susan enters to find them looking at the Oral Contacts website. Ben confesses to Susan that he was looking for Surfing Mel's website. He insults Susan by saying that Australians will have 'anything in a dress'. Ben tries to blame the rabbit for all his problems.

The next day, Susan and Ben explain to Michael that all parents argue and they are not getting a divorce. Janey arrives home from a visit to Surfing Mel. She is distraught that Mel thinks she is a child. Ben says he can probably fit her in on Monday. Isabelle arrives. She is shocked to see Nick is not a girl. She slaps him and storms away shouting in French. Nick says Ben still owes him fifty quid.

After visiting 4 different websites, Ben is now convinced he has just a year left to live and decides to write his will with the secondary purpose of trying to get his children to love (or just notice) him. Susan meanwhile organises Ben's funeral, not helped by Nick taking a job at the undertakers.</Overview>

  <Overview>Susan feels that she doesn't have enough time to do the housework while holding down her job, therefore decides to interview as many cleaners as possible to find the correct one. She then decides on Martha who not only does the cleaning but does the cooking as well and the rest of the family enjoy it. However as a result Susan starts to feel obsolete and tries to get rid of her by sabotaging the house and eating Ben's mint chocolate sweet left on his pillow.
Meanwhile Michael is trying to get a date with a girl at school who loves football by learning everything about football as possible (much to Ben's delight as this is the only subject he knows more than Michael about) and Abi is trying to get a job at a library by learning every single word in the dictionary!</Overview>

When Roger learns Swedish and decides he wants to meet Elke, Janey is forced to let him down by faking a call from Elke saying she's moved back to Sweden.

  <Overview>Ben's Uncle Norris dies, but the only inheritance he receives is a box of old clothes. Meanwhile, Susan receives ten thousand pounds through the will after the moral support she gave him during and after the death of Mildred. The wake is later held at the Harper’s house as it is in a convenient location. However, Ben’s purchase of a £60 suit and his general inconsiderate nature leaves him unpopular with everyone. Also, a mix up with Uncle Norris’s burial suit and Ben’s new suit leads to a winning lottery ticket going missing and a certain group of people going to pay their last repects, which unfortunately results in an embarrassment for the whole family. </Overview>

He's adamant that he will do no such thing, and that he will eat the fruit, vegetables and other food that she's left for him. Later on, he’s alone in the house, when the police turn up and ask him to be apart of an identity parade. He's very happy to do so, and shows off his moves… but his mood soon drops when he's formally arrested for a mugging! And ends up in a cell with fellow inmates Carl and Terry. On returning home, Ben is enjoying some tranquillity… until two familiar faces turn up on his doorstep, and his weekend soon turns to anything but the fun and relaxing time he set out to have especially when Verity, Carl's wife, turns up. </Overview>

She asks Michael, who can't because he's too pre-occupied with his split from Scott, then Roger comes round, who's still depressed about Abi. Just wanting some peace, Ben enquires about whether this old man – Harry - has Sky, and when he finds out that he does, he insists that he covers for her. He's quite capable of looking after an old man. Reluctantly, Janey hands over the keys, and his address, but tells Ben that the one thing he mustn't do is let Harry out of his sight.</Overview>

After their old one collapses, they go to get a new bed, which they argue over, until they find separate beds, which turns into separate rooms, which eventually turns into separate houses. Susan stays at her house, while Ben seeks solace in Roger, who's expecting a woman around. And while Susan is enjoying herself with lots of happy company, Ben is ruining Roger's evening with a woman. The following night, it's Susan's turn to find accommodation elsewhere, and she ends up in Michael and Scott's flat, where, as usual, she tries to take control of things. Ben then intrudes on Roger the following evening… mainly because he’s hungry, but Michael and Janey come around, begging him to apologise to Susan... they can't stand having their separate parents in each others' flats. Will they get back together, or will everyones' lives be ruined by their split?</Overview>

  <Overview>Ben returns home from a hard day's work, angrier than ever at the way Cavitex are now treating the dentists. He informs Susan that they've introduced time cards at work, and he is outraged because he doesn't have enough time to complete the crossword during his toilet break. The following morning, Ben has a meeting with fellow dentists, about the situation with Mr Griffith, where he makes a passionate speech against Mr Griffith and Cavitex, but when he receives a call from his boss, his attitude becomes much friendlier, especially out of earshot of his colleagues. Arriving at the office, Ben is uneasy of what to expect, but he's in for a surprise when Mr Griffith offers him a promotion. The array of items on &quot;his&quot; new desk distracts him from giving a proper answer to Mr. Griffith, but he soon accepts the position. Returning home, Ben attempts to show off his new suit and job to Michael, however, he's too busy playing his new game. The Cavitex meeting that evening cause Ben's old colleagues to realised they've been betrayed, especially when the answer to Roger's &quot;excessively polite demands&quot; causes both sides to take a step back. But as things come to a head for Ben, does he have a plan up his sleeve?</Overview>

  <Overview>Michael is enjoying the life of a layabout, but is soon distracted by Kenzo, who is upset at his report card - he's been given a C in Art. Michael soon realises that Kenzo has the same teacher as he used to have - Mr Tilley - and remembers that Tilley used to have an agenda against him. With Ben away at a conference - and still not having got the hang of texting - Susan throws herself into her work. At the art gallery, however, she's on the receiving end of some criticism from her boss, Katie, due to a badly designed and organized gallery, so Susan and a fellow colleague, Chris, are ordered to stay behind that night to sort it out. Later that night the work is finished, and Chris is very impressed. However, Susan starts discussing art in a very sensual manner, which leads to Chris coming onto her. Much to her surprise, she finds out that Chris has filed a complaint about Susan for sexual harassment which leads to Katie suspending Susan from her work. After taking advice from Janey, Susan invites Chris over to her house to talk him into dropping the complaint. Much to her surprise, Chris reveals that he is attracted to Susan.</Overview>

  <Overview>Michael and Janey decide to treat their parents to a Spanish holiday for their anniversary, but the flight is a living hell as Ben picks fights with the other passengers. Then there is the little matter of the virus outbreak which forces them into quarantine on arrival at the airport. Back home, Michael admits he charged the all-expenses-paid trip to Ben's credit card - now all he needs is a fast way of paying it back. As an idea, Michael and Janey decide to sell some antiques in order to appear on television, but the man from the show who visits them disapproves their antiques until he sees the old mantle clock that Susan adores. Taking a risk, the two decide to sell the antique but replace it with a modern clock. As soon as Ben and Susan arrive from their holiday, the modern clock goes off and Susan blames Michael and Janey... </Overview>

  <Overview>Susan feels in need of love and attention, and hopes dragging a reluctant Ben along on a spiritual course for couples will put the spark back into their marriage. Meanwhile, Michael and Janey are enjoying being the only responsible adults in the house when Matt - Michael's new boyfriend - manages to get into the house through the open front door, and joins the two of them in the kitchen where, much to Michael’s annoyance, Janey is invited out clubbing with them. Coming back home, Michael starts to wonder if Janey actually cares about him. Ben and Susan are attending a class which involves just one simple task - writing ten things you love about your partner. They also attend a class on meditation, but Ben fails to relax due to an overwhelming urge to break wind. When Matt and Janey are due to go out to lunch again, Matt accidentally says some horrible things about Michael. It seems that blood really is thicker than water. </Overview>

  <Overview>With Ben away on a volunteer dental programme in the Colombian rainforest, Janey is desperate for Susan to sign up to Facebook to get her friend count to a thousand, and even offers to set up her mother's account herself, which Susan declines. However, on seeing her profile, she's actually quite impressed. A message from Paul Tremayne also sends Susan down memory lane, and has Michael wishing for another father. The following morning, Susan is very impressed by the breakfast Janey is eating, but it's to her surprise to discover that Roger is the cook. Strangely, he's also taken on a role that Ben should have been doing for years - cleaning, fixing etc, and Susan takes full advantage of the situation. Later on that evening, Susan and Paul meet up for a chat, but unfortunately, the evening is cut short when Paul has to go off to run and errand in Chiswick and Susan offers to drop the package off for him. In doing so, she ends up getting arrested. It is not until she gets to the police station to find out that her old friend, Paul is a drug dealer whom the police have been trying to capture for a while. Susan is far from pleased. </Overview>

  <Overview>The Harpers are at Grace's funeral, and while Janey is concerned for her mother, Michael seems more interested in the backside of a young undertaker, Sean. Needing some time alone with her mother, Susan's grief soon turns into shock when her father, Arthur, suddenly turns up out of the blue very much alive. Susan's angry at his sudden re-appearance. After chatting with Ben, Arthur is surprised that Susan even married him in the first place, so he offers her £2 million to divorce him for good. Ben and Susan agree to the divorce, and decide they'll get married again after they receive the money. The following day, the two of them go to see a lawyer about getting divorced, but first they have to come up with a reason, and they're surprisingly imaginative. Michael's nerves get the better of him when he tells Sean that he is dying, just so he can spend some more time with him. After coming home from the lawyer they are shocked to discover that Arthur had passed away on the sofa while they were gone, and it seems that Arthur was lying all along and that he didn't actually have the money. Susan is disgusted with herself for even thinking about getting divorced for money. The following day, Michael finally plucks the courage to tell Sean that he isn't actually dying, but he may regret telling the truth. </Overview>
