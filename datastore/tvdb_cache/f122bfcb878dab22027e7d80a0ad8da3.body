  <Overview>In this ABC cute-com, which was derived from The Brady Bunch and Jim Henson's previous prime-time outing, Dinosaurs, the Henson company introduced us to a family oriented show consisting of a blended family -- half-aliens and half humans.  Each sickeningly sweet episode wrapped with a moral.  The aliens, with the exception of mother Cookie, were played by giant Muppets from Jim Henson's Creature Shop.   
Aliens in the Family is the story of a big-hearted human dad, Doug Brody, who was abducted by a spacecraft, fell in love with an alien single mom, Cookie, and returned to Earth to marry her and raise their unusual brood of human and alien children. Doug's two human kids, nine-year-old Adam and 14-year-old self-obsessed Heather, are alternately delighted and exasperated by their three extraterrestrial siblings”their brother Spit, 14, who was prone to grossing everyone out; bookish sister Snizzy, 10, who was reminiscent of Velma Dinkley from &quot;Scooby Doo&quot;; and baby brother Bobut</Overview>

  <Overview>Snizzy invents a duplicating machine that makes things nicer.  When Bobut insists on acquiring a Stinky Stevie doll (&quot;&quot;the doll that barfs on you&quot;&quot;) that his parents won't let him have, he clones himself and the real Bobut sneaks off to the toy factory.  Doug and Cookie fear that they've done something wrong to make cloned Bobut so insipidly sweet -- while the real Bobut finds himself being packed and shipped to two obnoxious rich children.</Overview>

  <Overview>Two of The Elders of the Neurtron Galactic Federation, the supreme beings who rule over the destinies of the alien Brody family members, pay a visit to see how future leader Bobut is being raised.

Meanwhile, Heather goes out of her way to impress a clique of popular girls by having Spit gross them out.</Overview>

  <Overview>Sally tries unsuccessfully to teach Bobut his ABC's.  Cookie's in a conundrum when she meets Doug's boss's wife, Holly, and realizes that she once abducted Holly and dissected her brain.  Doug tries to use the information to his advantage, which backfires when Holly announces she's getting a divorce.  Snizzie creates a breed of mutant Yuccles, a candy that she loves.  The puppet candies that call her &quot;&quot;Mommy&quot;&quot; are at first a burden, but they soon attack the school bully and finally move out and get their own TV show -- which bears a strong resemblance to &quot;&quot;Friends.&quot;&quot;</Overview>
