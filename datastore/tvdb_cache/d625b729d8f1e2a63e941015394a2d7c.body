<SeriesName>Scotland - The Edge of the Land</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/258467-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>A spectacular aerial journey up Scotland's western coastline. The edge of the land is where geography becomes history, much of what defines the Scots happened where the mountains tumble into the sea, where the Atlantic's long fingers reach into the heart of Scotland. From the air we see where man has patterned the landscape; the great city of Glasgow, the fisher towns of the west. We see the marks made by a thousand generations; the stones of Callanish, the brochs of Glenelg. The wild margins of Scotland have been shaped by the raw power of the ocean; the cliffs at Cape Wrath, the jagged ridge of the Cuillin. This DVD features the first six programmes from the popular Scottish Television series. Programme 1: Starting in Glasgow, down the Clyde to Arran, the Mull of Kintyre, the Isle of Gigha, throught the Crinan Canal to Inverary Castle. Programme 2: The stunning seascape of the Inner Hebrides: Islay and Jura, Oronsay, Colonsay and Mull, Tiree and Coll, Muck, Eigg, Rhum and Conna. Programme 3: Oban to Loch Kishorn: exploring Glencoe, Ben Nevis, the silver sands of Morar, Loch Duich, Eilean Donan Castle and the Five Sisters of Kintail Programme 4: The Isle of Skye, Kyleakin, the Sound of Sleat, the Black Cuillin, Dunvegan Castle and the bizarre rock formations of the Old Man of Storr. Programme 5: The Outer Hebrides the 130 mile long straggle of 200 islands, including Barra, Eriskay, Benbecula, Harris, Lewis and also the remote island of St Kilda. Programme 6: The Northwest Highlands, Loch Torridon, Gairloch, Inverewe Gardens, Honda Island Bird Reserve and Cape Wrath.</Overview>

<SeriesName>From the Edge With Peter Lik</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/253225-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Join one of the world's most acclaimed photographers in a brand-new action adventure nature series slated to debut on March 31, 2011 at 8PM on The Weather Channel. 

Hosted by Peter Lik, a native of Australia and one of the world's most awarded and collected fine art photographers, the show documents his odyssey across the United States in search of nature's most dramatic landscapes. The camera follows as he visits locations as varied as the volcanoes of Hawaii to the snows of Alaska's Denali National Park, often while battling or embracing the weather in his quest for the perfect shot. Throughout his travels, Lik reveals the country in a whole new perspective, capturing its diverse climates and natural beauty through his lens. 

"Bringing viewers along on my travels across the beautiful country will allow them to see parts of America that many have not had the pleasure of experiencing," says Lik. 

Bringing weather to life

The show - the network's first foray into original programming - was inspired in part by the thousands of viewers who share their passion for capturing Mother Nature by sending in their own photos to The Weather Channel and weather.com every week. This natural connection between photography and weather comes to life through the camera lens of Master Photographer Peter Lik, whose unique point of view will give viewers an amazing look at the country and some of its most treasured landscapes. 

Throughout the 13-episode season, Lik will travel far and wide across the country, to places as varied as the Big Island of Hawaii, the mountains of Montana and the awe-inspiring vistas of Arizona’s Grand Canyon, among many others. </Overview>

<SeriesName>On the edge - Improvisation in music</SeriesName>
<Overview>A series of four 55 minute films shown on Channel 4 TV in the UK in early 1992. To say this was the best and most intelligent analysis of improvisation to be 
screened on UK television is probably unnecessary: it has in all likelihood been the only televised programme on this form of music-making. Written and narrated by Derek Bailey, produced and directed by Jeremy Marre, it developed out of the first edition of Bailey's book on improvisation (the broadcast almost coinciding with the publication of the second edition) and attempted to provide a world-view of the subject, not being bound by country, musical genre or preconception.</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Edge</SeriesName>
<Overview>Welcome to The Edge guide at TV Tome.
The Edge was a skit comedy show that pushed the skits too the extreme on Fox. David Mirkin's creation featured notorious sketches such as "Cracklin' Crotch", a wild west parody complete with a cowboy whose crotch produces a "rice crispies" noise, and "Billy Kwong", a kung-fu spoof featuring the world's longest jump kick (literally, the camera followed a pair of outstretched legs as it pursued the victim, around corners and such).</Overview>
