  <Overview>The BBC Factual team behind the four-part live event BBC Two series flew off to Hawaii's Big Island at the end of last month confident that their focal point would help rather than hinder the programme's 'live' credentials.

BBC One's Planet Earth Live - which went out in May - led to critics questioning the format. The 'global wildlife event' was criticised for a dearth of live animal action and for presenter Richard Hammond's apparent lack of expertise.

Broadcast suggested that 'live' had become tv land's latest fix. ''Live' has become coke for commissioners,' it chuckled. 'Let's do some 'live' and everything will be so much better.'

Alan Holland, Volcano Live! producer, is aware of the censure but defends the live billing of his programme which, claims the publicity, will offer 'a unique insight into the life, impact and real-time activity of this powerful natural wonder'.

  <Overview>In 2010, the ash cloud from an unpronounceable Icelandic volcano brought Europe to a standstill. In this Volcano Live special, Kate Humble heads for the source of the ash to ask whether we should now be preparing for more of the same.

On her journey Kate meets the scientists monitoring the country's most dangerous volcanoes, and investigates the biggest eruptions in Iceland's past - including a catastrophic 18th-century event that killed thousands in Iceland and also appears to have led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people across Britain and Europe.

In 2010, it became clear that Britain is well within the reach of big Icelandic eruptions. To help prepare for the next one, what can we learn from the people who live right alongside them?</Overview>

  <Overview>Broadcasting from the summit crater, they look to the future of volcanic forecasting. Ed Byrne uses a bin, plastic balls and some liquid nitrogen to mimic a supervolcanic eruption, while Kate finds an Icelandic volcano which could put the eruption of Eyjafyallajokull in the shade.</Overview>
