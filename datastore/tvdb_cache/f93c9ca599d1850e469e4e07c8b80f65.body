  <Overview>Orphaned since birth, Aaron Corbett has finally found a loving and supportive home life on a farm. On his 18th birthday, just when his world is finally coming together, a series of dark visions disturb his sleep, and he develops a confusing array of supernatural talents. An Angel reveals the truth of his mysterious origins: He is a Nephilim, the child of a fallen Angel and a human mother. But he is not just any Nephilim; Aaron is the Redeemer, the embodiment of a prophecy that has tantalized Fallen Angels for millennia. Like all Nephilim, however, he is marked for death by a group of fierce warrior Angels called the Powers.</Overview>
