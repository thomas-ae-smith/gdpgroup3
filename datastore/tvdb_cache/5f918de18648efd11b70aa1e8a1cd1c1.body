    <Overview>Jesse James takes on the role of a modern-day daredevil in &quot;Jesse James Is A Dead Man&quot; a new, original weekly series on Spike TV premiering in February 2009, it was announced today by Sharon Levy, senior vice president of original series for Spike TV. &quot;Our goal was to create a new and distinctive series for Jesse that is unlike anything else on television,&quot; said Levy.

&quot;In this series, viewers will get to experience one of the most fearless guys on the planet in an entirely new way, taking on death-defying physical challenges each week.&quot; Each episode will follow James as he readies himself for a different death-defying challenge. Preparing for the risky challenge can often be as dangerous as the challenge itself as he endures a battery of tests to prepare.

With CGI effects, viewers get a taste of the enormity of the stunt, revealing the physiological stress James' body will endure. Some of the dangerous challenges he'll be facing include the harrowing, grueling and lawless off-road race, the Baja 500, and hitting over 200 mph on a Nitro bike supercharged by ultra-combustible nitro-methane fuel. Ten weekly one-hour episodes of &quot;Jesse James Is A Dead Man&quot; will be produced by BASE Productions (&quot;Sports Science&quot;, &quot;Fight Science&quot;) with Jesse James and his production company, Payupsucker Productions, serving as an executive producer.</Overview>
