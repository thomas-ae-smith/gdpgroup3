<Overview>Arthur Read, the spectacular bespectacled aardvark stars in this children's series about growing up. Typical childhood problems such as bratty siblings, schoolyard bullies and classroom cliques are addressed by this popular program which recently completed its ninth season on PBS. Developed from Marc Brown's beloved books, Arthur reminds us all of how it feels to be 8 years old. Just like your average kid, Arthur overcomes the dreaded obstacles of third-grade life, such as his tough teacher Mr. Ratburn, bullies, and mountains of homework. At home, Arthur must face the pint-sized terror also known as his sister Dora Winifred, or D.W. for short. Everything between these two is a struggle; who gets control of the television remote, who can play their Crazy Bus CD, whose hobbies are dumber, that's a baby show...Will Arthur ever win one of these pointless arguments? Prob'ly never, because not only is D.W. fiercely independent, she's also very smart. But despite it all, Arthur and D.W.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Arthur of the Britons</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/77053-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Arthur of the Britons was a drama series which aimed to throw light on the Dark Ages in Britain - an age in which Romanized Britons might have been led against invading Angles and Saxons by a Celtic warlord we now call King Arthur. Oliver Tobias gives us a virile and thoughtful Arthur, beset by problems at home and abroad, while Kai, his right hand man, was played by the late Michael Gothard. They are supported by a strong crew working on a limited budget, but in impressive locations. The series was last repeated in the UK in 1983, but at least one video tape of the production is still available - a ninety-minute compilation first issued in 1975 under the title 'King Arthur: Young Warlord'. 
"Historians know little that is factual about this period in our history, but upon one thing they are agreed - the legendary picture of Arthur is a fantasy, the truth was different. Camelot was an unlovely encampment of log and thatch within cunning defences."  - Patrick Dromgoole, Exec</Overview>

While searching for love and success throughout the rehearsal process, Arthur turns to his therapist (Jeffrey Tambor) and his best friend Chandler (Peter Chekvala) for advice.
