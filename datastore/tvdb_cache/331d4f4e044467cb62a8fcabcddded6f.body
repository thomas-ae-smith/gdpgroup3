  <Overview>There’s no denying it, Americans love fast food. It’s a love affair that stems from our passion for cars. As the automobile became more affordable, people became more mobile; as we moved about, our food needed to learn how to move with us. Inevitably, the fast food industry was born, and delicious meals were wrapped and ready to go. Who are those fast food industry kings that have fed our appetites for good food and fast service? Whose logos and products have become both popular brands and immediately identifiable pop icons? We’re climbing behind the wheel and heading cross-country to uncover all there is to know about our fast food favorites. Over the course of an hour we’ll learn the story of the visionaries behind Kentucky Fried Chicken, Wendy’s and McDonald’s. We’ll meet the people closest to them--family, friends and employees and reveal the passion and circumstances that drove them to succeed. On the way, we’ll take a look at how their ingenuity completely changed the way Americans eat. Buckle up as we set out to explore the world of America’s fast food kings. </Overview>

  <Overview>The unmistakable taste of a chocolate kiss. The popular chip-filled cookie inspired by a man dubbed &quot;Famous&quot;. The soft serve magic on a cone that birthed hundreds of stores. This triple threat of delectably, sweet and satisfying treats better known as--Hershey's chocolate, Famous Amos Cookies and Carvel Ice Cream--are three of America's favorite all-time guilty pleasures. For each of these men, timing was everything and had it not been for their great vision and relentless passion, none of their products would have even seen the light of day. How is it that a chocolate first created by Milton Hershey could change the name of an entire city? What was it about the Panama hat and Hawaiian shirt of Wally Amos that sold so many chocolate chip cookies? With so much ice cream around, how did Tom Carvelas manage to get hundreds to line up for his creative ice cream concoctions? For some, success was fleeting. For others, the road is still paved with rich and creamy chocolate gold.</Overview>

  <Overview>A quick fix is often the next best thing to a home cooked meal, dessert or snack. Nowhere else in American society do we see this fulfillment of need played out daily, but in the neighborhood grocery store. We often call these stores supermarkets because they stock an array of products designed to make our lives easier. From instant soup and pasta, to desserts and popcorn, there's not an inch of supermarket shelf or freezer space that doesn't offer something to be whipped up in a jiffy. Who are the innovators behind the dynasties of Campbell's Soup, Orville Redenbacher Popping Corn and pasta papa, Chef Boyardee? Discover where the concepts for these supermarket sensations were born and see where they might be in the future. </Overview>
