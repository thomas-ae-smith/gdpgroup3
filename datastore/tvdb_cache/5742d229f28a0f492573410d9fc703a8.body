  <Overview>This syndicated series is based loosely on the Mel Gibson-Robert Downey Jr. film of the same name. It lasted one season but only 22 episodes were aired in America. Four more episodes were produced and have been aired overseas. The plot deals with former CIA agent Rio Arnett (played by Lorenzo Lamas), who is the station chief and undercover agent who runs Air America, a commercial enterprise that flies everything from passengers and cargo to attack helicopters on covert missions. Rio operates along with his buddy and colleague Wiley Ferrell (played by Scott Plank) - posing as ordinary pilots - from the beautiful Central American country of Buenaventura. During the course of their many missions, Rio and Wiley often cross paths with the beautiful Alison Stratton (played by Diana Barton), who runs the Parador Hotel. Alison generally dislike both of them and hates that their work often cause damage to her hotel. Yet, she finds herself unwillingly attracted to Rio. Recurring charac</Overview>

  <Overview>Former war hero and diplomat Frank Arnett is working for the organization OSI (Organization for Strategical Intervention), which battles drug trafficing in Central- and South America. Currently, Frank leads a mission called 'Operation Jaguar', which includes getting Hector Ramirez - courier between the drug cartel and the corrupt government Buenaventura - brought to America along with his cartel ledgers that can bring the bad guys down. Hector's only demand is that his girlfriend Isabella must be taken to America as well. Frank requests that his son, Navy pilot Rio Arnett, be brought in to help with the mission. OSI director Willard Jenner okays Rio's involvment but Henry Stanley, another important OSI figure, is vehemently oppsosed to the idea. Rio goes to Buenaventura and discovers that on the mission he'll also be working with his old pal Wiley Ferrell. Wiley briefly shows Rio around, including the Parador Hotel, the only hotel around which is run by the beautiful Allison Stratton.</Overview>

Meanwhile, Rio is back in Buenaventura and gets aquainted with Allison Stratton, the new manager of the Parador Hotel. Allison detests Wiley and disagrees with the way he and Rio conduct their flights. She wants them to improve the look of the airport and give the tourists a better first impression so they'll want to stay at her hotel.
