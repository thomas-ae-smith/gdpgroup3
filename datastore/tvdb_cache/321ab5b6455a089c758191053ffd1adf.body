<Overview>Kohei Kuryu is a former juvenile delinquent who drops out of junior high and goes on to earn a high school equivalency diploma. After passing the law board exams, Kuryu becomes a prosecutor. Not your typical prosecutor, which is quickly seen through the clothes that he wears, Kuryu possesses quick instincts and a kind of cleverness that only someone raised on the streets could have.

Maiko Amamiya is a shrewd public prosecutor who has her eyes set on passing the exam to become a deputy prosecutor and tries her best to be noticed by her boss. Kuryu, on the other hand, after earning a reputation for doing top-notch work, is transferred to Amamiya's division, and finally opens his eyes to the possibility of promotion. Unfortunately, his unprecedented work behavior abruptly brings things to a halt.

Although earning a reputation as a bad apple, the influence from Kuryu's strong pursuit of justice slowly begins to change things around him. This drama is filled with it all; love, laughs and lots of emotion.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Dragon Quest: Legend of the Hero Abel</SeriesName>
<Overview>The story advances on in a normal Dragonquest video game fashion. Along the way, the Hero gains additional allies and has numerous encounters with many different creatures from the Dragonquest series. The end of each Japanese episode through to the 32nd episode shows one of the main characters going through a level up process. This adds to the Dragonquest video game feel.

The story is about a teenage boy named Abel and his best friend Tiala. On Tiala's 16th birthday she receives a red jewel. Unbeknownst to her, the red jewel has the power to awaken the great dragon, which legend has it can grant eternal life to one who drinks its blood. Baramos, a demon from the ancient and evil kingdom of Estark, desires to find the stone and gain immortality. After tracking the stone to Tiala's village, Baramos kidnaps her and sets off to find the location of the dragon. Abel, who was injured in a vain attempt to fight off Baramos is revived by his friend Moco and the village elder who gives him the blue stone, which he is told has the power to seal the dragon if it is woken. Baramos then returns again to the village in order to gain more information on the dragon's whereabouts. After doing so he leaves, but not before unleashing a giant anteater on the village. The elder uses a special crest to stun the beast and then Able and Moco finish it off. The elder imparts some advice to Abel before passing away and thus begins the adventure to save Tiala and defeat Baramos.

Abel and Moco travel to Ariahan Castle to get help from the king who helps them escape, via a teleport pool, from an ensuing monster invasion. During this time we are introduced to Daisy, who is at this time hunting monsters in Ariahan for the gems that they leave behind after being destroyed.

When Abel and Moco arrive at the other end of the teleport they gain Yanack to their party. They then do a quest together. Also during this time, a side story is going on explaining the exploits of Tiala onboard Gaim (a giant, living, flying airship used by Baramos) and how she befriends Dodonga.

As the story advances, the party is taken all over the world doing quests and seeking out Tiala whenever possible. They gain Daisy as another party member, and the four continue to quest to find a way to resurrect the Dragon of Legend so that it can defeat Baramos.

This makes up the story for the 13 episodes that were released in the US.</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Legend and The Hero II</SeriesName>
<Overview>In this CG effects-laden follow-up to the epic fantasy drama series The Legend and the Hero, the battles of good against evil and mortals against gods rage on in ancient China. This time, the central characters have been re-cast, with Hong Kong movie star Ray Lui replacing Steve Ma Jing Tao as the ruthless Emperor Zhou, who is bewitched by the foxy beauty Daji, now played by popular Taiwan singer/actress Ruby Lin. Leaving that infamous role is Mainland star actress Fan Bingbing, who makes a cameo appearance as Chang-o. Based on historical accounts as well as mythological legends, The Legend and the Hero II depicts King Wu (rising star Victor Huang in place of Zhou Jie) leading other feudal lords in an earth-shattering revolt against Emperor Zhou.</Overview>
