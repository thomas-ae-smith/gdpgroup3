<Overview>Given Hollywood’s fascination with the Old West, you’d be forgiven for thinking there’s been no stone left unturned in depicting some of the era’s most colourful characters; many of the truths have been distorted by myth - until now. "The Wild West" is the docudrama series that re-evaluates three of most famous figures of the time – Colonel Custer’s last stand at Little Bighorn, Billy the Kid and the role that Wyatt Earp played in the gunfight at the OK Coral. "The Wild West" presents the facts, uncovering secrets and twists, proving once and for all, fact can be a lot interesting than fiction.</Overview>

<Overview>The Wild Wild West told the story of two Secret Service agents: James T. West, the charming gunslinger (played by Robert Conrad), and Artemus Gordon (played by Ross Martin), the brilliant gadgeteer and master of disguise. Their unending mission was to protect President Ulysses S. Grant and the United States from all manner of dangerous threats. The agents traveled in luxury aboard their own train, the Wanderer, equipped with everything from a stable car to a laboratory. James West had served as an intelligence and cavalry officer in the US Civil War; his "cover" during the series is that he is a railroad president. After retiring from the Service by 1880 he lives on a ranch in Mexico. Gordon's past is more obscure; when he retires in 1880 he goes on the road as the head of a Shakespeare traveling players troupe.</Overview>

<Overview>The small Cornish town is host to all manner of odd occurrences, in Simon Nye's dark comedy. Dawn French and Catherine Tate star as Mary and Angela - a tempestuous lesbian couple, who will do anything to preserve their village from the hordes of holiday home buyers and thrill-seeking bungee-jumpers.  Pretty much all outsiders are a target for suspicion.

Nye said, ''I wanted to show life in a small community because there's nothing like an inward-looking village for paranoia, jealousy and fear, and these emotions can be horribly funny. They say writers' work gets darker as they get older, but in fact mine is generally getting sunnier and sillier.''</Overview>
