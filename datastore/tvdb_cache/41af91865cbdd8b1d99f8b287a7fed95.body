<SeriesName>House of Consignment</SeriesName>
<Overview>“House of Consignment” is a new 10 episode, half-hour reality series featuring Chicago entrepreneur and fashion maven, Corri McFadden, and her mission to improve the way women shop. By working with high-end clients at her sleek, Lincoln Park retail store, eDrop-Off, Corri’s consignment business turns luxury brand items into profit. What began as Corri’s senior project in fashion design school has turned her into a young, successful business woman and owner of a booming multi-million dollar company. Watch as Corri and her team of twenty-something fashionistas change the face of the consignment world on a daily basis.
The show takes the cliche about “One man’s trash being another man’s treasure” and turns the trash, in this case Fendi bags and Jimmy Choos, into cash. Using her innate sense of style and business savvy, Corri McFadden resells high-end fashion items that have been rescued from her wealthy clients’ overflowing closets. Billed as “part intervention, part fashion lesson”, it’s also part interactive shopping experience, because viewers will be able to bid on certain items seen the show throughout the season.</Overview>

<Overview>The Tang Dynasty was one of imperial China most prosperous periods, in which the arts flourished. The royal family particularly enjoyed a good dance and music performance. Thus, a prestigious competition was held to find talented individuals in the arts.  The winner will be granted a title of Princess by the Emperor.

A street muscian wanted for murder, Bobby Au Yeung, assumes the identity of an Imperial Music Bureau official (Evergreen Mak) to preserve his safety. Due to his partial amnesia, Evergreen forgot about his imperial post and instead, finds a job as a kitchen chef.
 
Enjoying his newfound wealth, Bobby was afraid that he will soon be found out to be an imposter and lose his life. One lie leads to another lie. Bobby sets out to break off his engagement with Evergreen betrothed bride, Linda Chung, afraid that his identity will otherwise be found out. 
However, Linda decides to join the Imperial Music Bureau to train for the upcoming national music and dance competition in order to get closer to her fiance, whom she mistakens to be Bobby Au Yeung. Linda befriends Myolie Wu, a fellow dancer in the Imperial Music Bureau. The worn sisters are also rivals in love and on court; will Bobby break the womens friendship beyond repair?
 Due to Bobby assuming Evergreens identity, a confusing love rectangle of unclear romantic relationships develop. Evergreen slowly regains his memories, realizing who he truly is and Bobbys farce. The stakes rise as the national music and dance competition draws close, in which the foursome are eager to demonstrate their individual talents before the royal family. Who will emerge as the final winner? Will they be able to all live in harmony and find happiness?</Overview>

Stars of every Disney film ever made are seated in the audience, often becoming part of the show themselves, as Mickey and his friends entertain and… More premiere original cartoons.

Now, Mickey's House Of Villains makes it's way on DVD and Video Sept. 3, 2003 for the villains musical number "It's Our House Now." Characters Mickey Mouse - Emcee Mickey Mouse hosts the nightclub, that's the hottest spot on Main Street, and the tooniest place on Earth, The House of Mouse . He is a kind-hearted and popular American icon that's been around since the '20s, and has been the Disney mascot since. Minnie Mouse - When pandemonium breaks loose anywhere in the club, you can always count on Mickey's girlfriend, Minnie, to straiten things out from behind the scenes. When Mickey starts to panic from pressure, Minnie's there to calm him down. Pluto - Mickey's faithful dog, Pluto, is also there, behind the scenes, keeping things in order. Donald Duck - Donald Duck, owns The House of Mouse 50-50 with his best friend, Mickey. It's also his job to greet guests at the door. He can loose his temper very easily, but he can remain calm, if he tries... sometimes. Daisy Duck - Donald's girlfriend, Daisy Duck, is responsible for having guests reserved and seated. She also does some pretty weird stuff every time Mickey gives her a chance on the stage. Goofy Goof - Mickey and Donald's other friend, Goofy, is headwaiter of the club. With his clumsiness, we can be sure a lot of dishes are broken! Despite that, and that he shows little common sense, he's a loyal friend. Maximilian "Max" Goof - Goofy's skateboard-cool, teenage son is valet of the club. Now, if only he could get his own car. Gus Goose - Gus is the club cook. Just try to keep him from eating the food. Clarabelle Cow - This cow is the queen of Main Street gossip. If she hears something juicy, she can't keep her mouth shut! Horace Horsecollar - Horace is in charge of all multimedia works of the club. He runs cartoons, lights, sounds, you name it. The one line you're bound to hear directed to him is, "Hit it, Horace!" Pete - Pete is the landlord of the building The House of Mouse takes place in... and he'll do anything to stop the show and shut down the club.</Overview>

<SeriesName>House Rules (1998)</SeriesName>
<Overview>Welcome to the House Rules guide at TV Tome.
Here is how NBC described the show:  "A buddy comedy about three Gen Xers who share a house in Denver: Friends meets Three's Company. The series chronicles the adventures of three lifelong, ski-loving friends: Casey, a deputy district attorney; McCusky, a medical student; and Riley, a reporter. We were meant to find them charmingly irresponsible and free-spirited. We did not. In contrast to the similarly themed triangle comedy Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place, this made delayed adolescence seem, well, childish.  "The unique friendship shared by a trio of childhood chums and roommates from Denver is the focus of this half-hour comedy. Through romances, job problems and the trials and tribulations of daily life, a woman and her two male roommates give modern romance a decidedly comic spin.  "'House Rules is about two men and a woman in their mid-twenties who, after 20 years of growing up together, going</Overview>

<SeriesName>Manor House</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/72507-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Manor House also known as 'The Edwardian Country House' was an acclaimed British mini-series in the reality tv genre, produced by Channel 4.

It was first aired in the UK in April 2002 and was later broadcast in the U.S. on various PBS stations in 2003 as Manor House, where extra footage was added.

In the series the Olliff-Cooper family are given the identities of turn-of-the-century aristocrats and housed in Manderston, an opulent Scottish country house, where they live for three months in the Edwardian style. Mr. and Dr. Olliff-Cooper become Sir John Olliff-Cooper, Bt, and Lady Olliff-Cooper.

Interest and conflict is provided by the 14 servants, portrayed by individuals from several walks of life. Chief among these was Hugh Edgar, an architect from Surrey, who was cast in the role of the butler.

Participants received instruction and a set of rules by which they were expected to abide for the duration of the experiment. Most of the ‘upstairs’ participants enjoy their time in the house, which is meant to represent the years 1905-1914. Those ‘below stairs’ have a different experience; for those in the lowest ranks, particularly the successive scullery maids, life appears to be intolerable.</Overview>
