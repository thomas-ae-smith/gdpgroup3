  <Overview>This listing comprises not only the original CBS show, but also the Showtime additional seasons: The Paper Chase: Second Year, The Paper Chase: Third Year, and The Paper Chase: Graduation Year Based on the movie, written by John Osborne, The Paper Chase is a classroom drama about students in a law school (based on Harvard Law School). The two main characters are a stern but fair Contract Law professor, Charles W. Kingsfield, and a student who idolizes him, James Hart. The Paper Chase was voted the best new drama of 1978. 
Although the critics raved it didn't get the &quot;numbers&quot; that CBS wanted and it was cancelled after its first season. Five years later Showtime picked it up and made 3 new seasons of episodes from 1983-1986.</Overview>

  <Overview>James Hart (James Stephens), a farmboy from Minnesota, starts his first year of law school. Being unprepared for his first day of &quot;&quot;Contracts&quot;&quot; he is 'shrouded' by Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. (John Houseman), pronouncing the hapless Hart as &quot;&quot;dead&quot;&quot; in his class. This means that  he will never call on Hart and his part of the class's &quot;&quot;Socratic dialogue will be at an end. Hart finds out that Kingsfield shrouds one student each year and that student remains deceased all year long. Kingsfield is the reason Hart has chosen to come to this school; we are shown a couple of his nightmares now that he is the &quot;&quot;former Mr. Hart&quot;&quot;.
Another student, Franklin Ford III (Tom FitzSimmons), is organizing a study group and invites Hart to join. The members of the study group decide to have each member do an outline of one of the classes that they can then copy for each member of the group. Hart wants to do the Contracts outline but the others worry that Hart cannot be effective if he is shrouded.  In</Overview>

  <Overview>Anderson pushes Hart to run for the first-year slot on the Law School Council. Elsewhere, Ford's father and sister come for a visit.

To impress his father, Ford decides to run for the Law Council post (against Hart) which forces the study group members to choose sides. Hart's part-time job is at Ernie's Tavern.</Overview>

Meanwhile, Bell misplaces his Property outline (actually stolen by Ford, as a prank). Elsewhere, Logan is arrested when her off-hand legal advice to some high school girls results in a riot at the girls' private school.</Overview>

  <Overview>As part of Prof. Rolf's prison internship program for first year students, Logan is assigned to help in a hearing of a political activist, Eric Ryerson, who was put in solitary confinement for stabbing a fellow prisoner. Ryerson convinces Logan that the prison establishment is only supressing him for his political activism and Logan is taken in, emotionally as well.
Kingsfield is not in favor of this program because he believes that the students are not ready scholastically and that it takes away valuable time from their other studies. Logan is banished to the back bench in his class for being late as a result of her work in the program.
Hart displays his fluency in Spanish, acting as interpreter of another prisoner, Sanchez - the prisoner who was stabbed. At first Sanchez denies that it was Ryerson who stabbed him (because he and other prisoners are afraid of Ryerson), but we find out that Ryerson stabbed him because Sanchez would not give Ryerson a cool pair of sunglasses.

  <Overview>This episode focuses on Tom Clayton, the guy with the &quot;&quot;photographic memory&quot;&quot; in the study group.  Early in the episode Kingsfield intimidates Tom to the point he is incapable of speaking and freezes up. In an effort to &quot;&quot;start at the very beginning&quot;&quot; and teach him how to talk again, Kingsfield tells him to say &quot;&quot;da da&quot;&quot;.  In this episode Tom's wife, Karen, announces she's pregnant.  Faced with stresses due to his (losing) struggle with law school and the further complication of having a child, Tom goes on a drinking binge and falls behind in Kingsfield's class.  In an all-night cram session, where members of the class impersonate Kingsfield, Tom is helped to learn to synthesize the material he so easily memorizes into fully developed ideas and he is able to make a good showing in the actual class the next day.</Overview>

On top of that, Ernie, his employer, asks him to manage the tavern for the weekend while he's away.  Meanwhile, Willis Bell, the portly, disorganized member of the study group who's always perceverating about his 200+ page property outline becomes obsessed with his goofy picture on Kingsfield's seating chart.  He believes that it's why he always gets called on first in each class and sets about to get his picture changed.  When Kingsfield's secretary declines to change it without his approval, Bell arrives on the hair-brained scheme to break into Kingsfield's office and change it.  While everything possible is going wrong at Ernie's and the index is still looming large, Hart inexplicably agrees to accompany Bell in this ill-fated mission becoming the Ethyl to Bell's Lucy.

  <Overview>This is one of the standout episodes written by the John Jay Osborn, Jr., the author of the original book and screenplay for the 1974 movie.  Moot court is the chance for first year law students to compete against each other (in teams of two) in a courtroom setting in front of a distinguished panel of judges, including Kingsfield.  To win is a high prestige â€“ Kingsfield himself won this competition when he was in law school there.  Teams are drawn at random and the pairings are: Hart and Logan (a pseudo romantic relationship ensues), Bell and Raymond Livingston (a new character introduced for this episode), Anderson and Gagarian (minor emphasis on this pair), and other minor pairings.
Raymond Livingston is being put through law school by the military, he is black, and from an economically challenged background.  He is highly motivated to achieve in all endeavors of his life and unhappily finds himself in a team with the lazy, slovenly Bell who doesn't care to win (his main focus has al</Overview>

During a question and answer session in Kingsfield's class, Logan confronts the judge as to why he has never hired a female law clerk. Professor Kingsfield attempts to stifle her, yet she persists, but does not get an answer from the judge. News of Logan's audacity quickly spreads across campus, and to national women's activist organizations, who send a bunch of demonstrators/hecklers to campus for the judge's celebratory speech. Much to Logan's dismay, the outsiders have turned it into an embarrassing circus.</Overview>

  <Overview>A new student, Paul Chandler, joins the class mid semester.  He is wheelchair bound yet athletic and handsome.  The study group welcomes him in and in their interactions we gradually see that contrary to the good initial impression Chandler makes, he is manipulative, takes advantage of his situation, and is highly competitive.  We also learn that through his mother he is friends (on a first name basis) with Kingsfield.
Chandler's competitive nature reveals its dark side when he sets his sights on Hart.  He tries to seduce Logan, thinking that she is Hart's girlfriend, he applies to a need-based scholarship that Hart is trying hard to win, and both he and his mother try to use their relationship with Kingsfield to win the scholarship.  Finally, in Kingsfield's office, he experiences a life changing moment where he sees himself as what he is and turns over a new leaf.</Overview>

  <Overview>Kingsfield has his students form groups to argue both sides of a case of their choice. When Hart's study group selects a case that the professor lost early in his career, they start to question his ethics after they learn that he did not file what appears to them to be a routine appeal. Even Hart has his doubts after a now-prominent attorney who assisted Kingsfield on the case refuses to shed light on the matter. </Overview>

  <Overview>This episode further develops Kingsfield's character and fleshes-out his past.  It begins with the news that Ernie's bar, a favorite campus hangout for generations, will be closed along with the other small businesses on the block.  All the buildings will then be razed for parking for a new gym the college is building.  Kingsfield has been retained by the school to represent the school's interest in the project.  Meanwhile, Hart has taken on the cause to save Ernie's (where he works) and he confronts Kingsfield in his office.  After some difficulty finding a lawyer who will take the case, Hart appeals to Kingsfield's nostalgic side by telling him he knows that he frequented that establishment back in his law school days in the 1930's because there is a table with his initials carved in it.  This sparks some distant memory in Kingsfield's mind and he pays a visit to Ernie's.  It so happens that the original Ernie, Sr. is there at the same time and they recognize each other and reminisce</Overview>

  <Overview>Although this was not the last episode shown, as the production numbers tell, it was the last one produced.   I remember that the last episode was about Hart falling in love with a Russian gymnast. John Houseman did not appear as Kingsfield in this episode. I heard that, because the network had caused the scripts to be &quot;&quot;dumbed&quot;&quot; down to this level, that Houseman refused to be in it. A visiting professor played by Pernell Roberts had to help Hart with his love life. I also understand that Houseman refused to do the Showtime seasons unless it was understood that this episode would never be reshown.</Overview>

  <Overview>The main story concerns a &quot;&quot;scavenger hunt&quot;&quot; assignment that Prof. Kingsfield gives the students. They must get at least 70 questions correct out of 100 concerning various aspects of contract law whose answers may be found anywhere in the University. There are no rules and anyone who does not get the required numbers of questions will flunk the assignment.
A secondary story line involves the visit of Bell's younger sister, Lisa (Wendy Rastatter), onto the scavenger hunt crazed campus. She is a free spirit who ends up &quot;&quot;distracting&quot;&quot; Ford from his scavenger hunt obligations to his study group.
Bell shines as the &quot;&quot;bulldog&quot;&quot; of the scavenger hunt, outdoing even the illustrious Hart at finding answers to the questions.   THINKING LIKE A LAWYER: The purpose of contracts is not simply words on a page. Contracts evolved as a vehicle and context for people to cooperate and work together to achieve that which they cannot do individually and in a way that is fair to everyone.</Overview>
