  <Overview>In the first show, Headmaster Mike is the head of the household. He likes everything and everyone to be in order, and to be able to access anyone's school reports, including the contestant's.

Mum Diane is in her 40s, highly emotional and stressed - she's not afraid to show her true feelings. Meanwhile brother James (J-Pac) is a wannabe rapper and compares himself to 2Pac but is as far from a real rapper as you can get, and he's anything but cool. Sister Jessica, 24, has recently returned from a gap year travelling and 'found herself' - something that she likes to talk about endlessly.

Gary the gardener is employed by Diane. He is smug, loves the ladies and is very open when it comes to doing 'extras'. Throughout the episode the contestant will notice some strange goings-on between the mother and the gardener, the question is, will he confess all to Mike when put on the spot?

If the boyfriend can endure a full five hours in the house he will win himself and his girlfriend a holiday but if he tries to leave, he'll go with no prize, pride or possibly relationship!</Overview>

  <Overview>Twenty-year-old Josh is currently unemployed, loves going to festivals and spending time with his nan. He's been dating Holly for three months and now he's about to meet her family, but he's blissfully unaware that the family are all actors who will make life as uncomfortable as possible for him.

Holly's dad Ken is the leader of his own religion. He thinks of his house as his church and is allowed as many wives as he wants. Mum Pauline's OCD condition means everything has to be clean, precise and in order - this includes making Josh count all of his peas at dinner. Ken's second wife is Fillipa, a Russian cleaner he bought off the internet and she's in constant competition with Pauline for Ken's attention.

Brother Chris, or Christine as he likes to be known, loves X Factor and dreams of dating the small one from JLS. During his five hour ordeal, Josh endures Holly's brother's X Factor audition piece, and is put on the spot as to whether he wants to marry Holly, right there and then!

If Josh can manage a full five hours in the house he will win himself and Holly a holiday, but if he tries to leave he'll go with no prize, pride or possibly relationship.</Overview>
