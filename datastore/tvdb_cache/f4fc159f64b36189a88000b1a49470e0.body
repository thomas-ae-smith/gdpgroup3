<SeriesName>Fraggle Rock: The Animated Series</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/139151-g.jpg</banner>
<Overview>The animated series followed the same formula as the HBO original live-action series, including the same theme song. Many episodes consisted of two 15-minute stories; however, a few presented a single full 30-minute plot. The animated version carried on the tradition of original songs, with at least one tune per episode (including a few recycled from the puppet version, such as "Let Me Be Your Song").

In its original run, the animated episodes were book-ended by footage of the original puppet version of Uncle Traveling Matt, introducing the show from Doc's workshop. The animated version of Fraggle Rock was cancelled after only one season (13 episodes).

The most noticeable difference is that unlike the live-action version, the animated version of Doc is shown from the neck down, much like Nanny was on Muppet Babies.</Overview>

Being the new kid on the block is hard enough; it's even harder when your dad is Rock Zilla, a super-popular seven-foot-tall billionaire rock star. Rock suddenly decides to go into semi-retirement, and moves the family to a house in the sleepy suburb of Silent Springs. Willy, Rock Zilla's 12-year-old son, thinks that all his dreams have come true. But he soon learns that when hotel rooms and tour buses are the only home you've ever known, living in a small town, as the son of a famous celebrity, can present a whole lot of unexpected challenges. Aided by komoto dragon Mosh and best friends Alissa and Quincy, Willy tries his best to live a "normal" life in the burbs. My Dad the Rockstar
Opening Theme Lyrics It's so hard just to feel normal
When everyone is completely paranormal and
Everything is totally deranged
And you're the only one who's sane
Sometimes it gets
So unbearable
But mostly I feel

<banner>graphical/77177-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>A six-part satirical take on the music world written by BAFTA award-winner Bryan Elsley centered around a young Glasgow band - Jocks Wa Hey - as they struggle to find success.

The unlikely chart-toppers who form Jocks Wa Hey are Jez, the cocky lead singer, his best pal Psycho, the unkempt, scuzzy little bass player; Wullie 'The Bigot' MacBoyne, psychopathic drummer, the hard-hitting, ballsy lead guitarist Joe Nardone and Fiona, DSS Officer by day and Queen of Electronica by night.

Across six episodes they recruit new members, revolutionize their sound, acquire management, arrange a showcase gig, get signed, record a hopeless album and somehow manage to get to the top of the charts.</Overview>

<SeriesName>The Rock 'n' Roll Years</SeriesName>
<banner>graphical/96411-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>Documentary series which revisits the years from when rock 'n' roll began, connecting the events with the music via newsreels, headlines, movies, broadcasts, and rock performance footage. The Rock 'n' Roll Years was a BBC television programme aired between 1985 and 1994. In a half-hour time slot the programme focused on a different year each week, starting with the year 1956 and ending with 1989.

The format of the programme, which was based on the BBC Radio 1 series 25 Years of Rock, was primarily of news clips with narrative subtitles set to music of the time with no presenters or voice-overs. Archive footage of performers, mostly from BBC programmes such as Top of the Pops, was also featured. For instance, the programme on 1960 featured the Sharpeville massacre, the Russians shooting down two US spy planes, the advent of stiletto heels and the election of Kennedy to the White House set to music by Adam Faith, Duane Eddy and the Rebels, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, the Everly Brothers and Roy Orbison

Like 25 Years of Rock the programme was noted for its occasionally witty juxtaposition of news footage with appropriate songs, as when an excerpt from the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana - in an episode made after the couple had split up - was accompanied by Lionel Richie and Diana Ross singing "Endless Love".</Overview>
