<Overview>Based on the critically acclaimed novel of the same name, this series provided a hopeful, yet honest look at life in the new South.  Set in the fictional Sparta, Mississippi, the show was a marvelous blend of heartfelt drama and folksy humor.  It portrayed both the professional and personal pursuits of Sparta P.D's officers.  Series star Carroll O'Connor, in a role far removed from Archie Bunker, served as executive producer.  Using the pen name Matt Harris, Mr. O'Connor was also the story editor and wrote many of the episodes.</Overview>
