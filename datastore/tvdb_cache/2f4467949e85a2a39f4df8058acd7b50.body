  <Overview>Gary and Wyatt both want to spend time with Lisa.  The problem is, they both want to spend time with Lisa.  Gary wants to go to a party with Lisa while Wyatt wants Lisa's help in studying for a Science test.  Lisa fixes this problem by dividing herself into two different Lisa.  One Lisa who likes to do nothing but party and one Lisa who is only interested in studying.  The guys both realize quickly that this was a bad idea.  Wyatt's bored because his Lisa doesn't have one ounce of fun in her.  Gary's tired because his Lisa wants to do nothing but party- twenty-four hours a day.  To make her point more clear, Lisa turns the guys into trolls, as well as Chett.</Overview>

  <Overview>Gary and Wyatt want to win the school talent show.  How do they go about winning?  Simple.  They get Lisa to create a magic book that lets them do real magic tricks.  The guys can now slice people in half and create demonic creatures that come from hell. (The slicing in half tricks lead to Chett getting an eye-full in the bathroom, when he walks in on Wyatt's lower half using the facilities.)  Principal Scampi enjoys the boys' show so much that he asks them to perform at a dinner party he's hosting.  Principal Scampi has a great idea for the grand finale- the guys can chop off his head!  The only problem is that the magic book has been ruined and there is no way to reverse any of the magic that the guys use.</Overview>

Lisa makes it so the boys can get what they want- They swap places.  Now Wyatt can have Al and Emily Wallace, two parents that are always at home, and Gary can live with Wyatt's parents and be on his own.

Not only is Jeremy Scanlon now dating Gary's old crush, he's also student body president.  Now Gary wants revenge on the boy that tied him to a tree wearing nothing but a sock.  So, Lisa takes the boys back to summer camp in 1985 and they pose as camp counselors.  The guys save the eight year old Gary from getting tied to the tree.  While at the camp, Wyatt finds that the English teacher he has a crush on used to work there as a camp counselor in 1985, when she was his age.  Now he has a chance with her!  When the gang returns to present-day, it turns out that their plan worked a little too well.  Jeremy is no longer the man that he once was.

Wyatt asks Lisa to zap up &quot;&quot;A Man's Man's World&quot;&quot; and creates a monster truck-cigar-jerky-paintball store, since those are the only thing that Chett's any good at.
