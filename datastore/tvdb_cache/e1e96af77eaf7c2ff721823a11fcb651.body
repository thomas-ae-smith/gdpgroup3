    <Overview>Television series often depict the lives of law enforcement, lawyers, and victims, but while they attempt to make sense of tragedy, who stays behind to remove the gruesome mess? &quot;TRUE GRIME&quot; introduces viewers to the strong-stomached team at Crime Scene Cleaners who do just that. Follow owner Neal Smither and his crew as they respond to calls in real time and try to erase the physical reminders of graphic events. From sports cars toting murder scenes to homes hiding unsanitary secrets, the team's &quot;office&quot; changes daily. It's the type of company you hope never to call, but if you do, you're glad it exists.</Overview>
