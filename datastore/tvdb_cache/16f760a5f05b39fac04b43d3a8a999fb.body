<Overview>Based on the award-winning book by S.E. Hinton and the film by Francis Coppola, comes the TV series of "The Outsiders". The story of the Curtis brothers, Darry, Soda Pop, and Pony Boy, struggling to make it as a family.  According to Ponyboy, there's two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for "social") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine.  A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser. This classic, written by S. E. Hinton when she was 16 years old, is as profound today as it was when it was first published in 1967.</Overview>
