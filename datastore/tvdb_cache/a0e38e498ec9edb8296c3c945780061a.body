  <Overview>Rehersals for a VIP fasion show were underway. PO Sylvia  Hollamby stupidly ignored a pregnant inmate's calls for a doctor but then worried when the inmate was found in a pool of blood the next morning - she then denied that the inmate had asked for a doctor. A near riot followed when the inmates discovered this! Nikki Wade was taken down 'The Block' for being the 'ringleader'.
New wing governor, Helen Stewart, cancelled the fasion show but was then bullied into reinstating it by her superior, Simon Stubberfield, who said he'd sack her if she didn't! Another inmate, Rachel, was moved to a cell next to the vindictive Shell Dockley, who verbally abused her through the wall - unknown to her, Rachel was getting 'Special Attention' from PO Jim Fenner! Helen's Boyfriend, Sean, Arrived at her flat.</Overview>

  <Overview>Monica Lindsay and Zandra Plackett arrived at Larkhall. We learned later that Monica has a 30 year old son, Spencer, who has down's syndrome. Helen Stewart took a stand against drugs and formed the Dedicated Search Team (DST). Shell forced Rachel to write to the DST naming Nikki - the DST then raided Nikki's cell but obviously found nothing. Denny took an instant dislike to Zandra, saying that she owed her drugs from the last time she was at Larkhall. Shell, once again, verbally abused Rachel.</Overview>

Nikki warned Rachel about Jim Fenner, telling her that he had also slept with Shell - Rachel asked him this and of course, he denied it! New inmate Crystal Gordon arrived, complete with her guitar.

  <Overview>Zandra decided that she wanted an abortion, after a talk with Helen, Dominic and Lorna were assigned to take her to the clinic. At the clinic, she escaped for a few hours but, to the PO's relief, was found, still inside the clinic. The PO's didn't tell Helen about it because they knew they'd get an official warning. Back at Larkhall, Shell was still making Rachel's life hell by wanting Rachel to make her mother bring drugs in! Nikki learned that her girlfriend, Trisha, is seeing someone else. Rachel's Mother didn't bring any drugs and later, Shell once again intimidated Rachel as a result. Next morning, as Zandra woke, she screamed as she saw Rachel hanging next to her!

  <Overview>Dominic wanted to come clean to Helen about Zandra's attempted escape but Lorna peruaded him not to because she didn't want an official warning. Jim tried to get his and Shell's stories straight (about their affair) because Helen was highly suspicious of him. Fenner, Helen and Stubberfield took part in a meeting where Helen voiced her thoughts about Jim and vice-versa; Stubberfield seemed to take Jim's side, calling Helen's motives 'tenuous'. Nikki was spared from a spell down the block by Helen, prompting the PO's to see 'favouritism' taking place, especially when Denny was shipped down the block for the same offence! Zandra blackmailed Lorna saying that if she didn't bring her drugs, she'd tell all about her escape at the clinic. Lorna had no choice to oblige. Stubberfield questioned Helen's ability to do her job.</Overview>

  <Overview>Alchoholic Jessie Devlin arrived at G-Wing for 2 weeks, and was ridiculed by the inmates, and Sylvia, for being drunk. Later that night, at the pub, Dominic blabbed the truth about Zandra's escape at the clinic, to Helen. She was angry and said she'd have to tell Stubberfield. Denny attacked Jessie with a fork and, when asked why she had done it, admitted that Jessie was her mother who had abandoned her as a child. After her release, Jessie sent Denny a letter saying that she hadn't had a drink for 2 days and asked for a visiting order. Helen told Dominic that she had told Stubberfield about Zandra's attempted escape and that his and Lorna's jobs were safe. Sadly for Lorna, no-one had told her as she was in the process of smuggling in valium for Zandra!</Overview>

  <Overview>Sean proposed to Helen but she left for work, leaving him to ponder. Shell and Denny kicked Zandra and made her tell them who her supplier was - then they made her lure Lorna into the toilets. Lorna declined to get Zandra more drugs until Shell emergedfrom the cubicle and threatened her. Lorna then smuggled more drugs in and was nearly caught by Fenner. Spencer visited Monica but looked ill. Nikki was moved into a new, better room as a privilage. Sean did a presentation at the prison where he was introduced as Helen's partner; much to Nikki's disgust. After seeing inmates entering and leaving Shell's cell, Dominic investigated and found drugs in the Budgie's cage. Shell then shouted that it was Lorna who supplied them - only Fenner beleived her though. Shell had her priveliges removed after the drugs incident so took out her anger on the budgie - poor little thing!</Overview>

  <Overview>Shell told Crystal that she wanted her to write an article to a newspaper about the drugs problem at Larkhall - this got Crystal into trouble with Helen and Helen into trouble with Stubberfield. Shell also revealed to Crystal that she wanted to set up Lorna. She persuaded Lorna to bring her some perfume that had some very well hidden drugs inside - Lorna didn't notice them but Helen certainly did when Shell showed her! Lorna got the sack! Shell was therefore very unpopular on G-Wing. Monica planned suicide but was talked out of it by Nikki and a new inmate, Yvonne Atkins arrived.</Overview>

  <Overview>In the final episode of the first series, we saw a petition being passed around to bring back open visits, which were banned earlier by Stubberfield after he heard about the drug problem. Yvonne wanted to make Sylvia sign so she set up a Gospel choir. Eventually the plan worked and Sylvia signed...just to stop the terrible music! Shell told Fenner that she could fix him like she did Lorna Rose. This infuriated him, making him bang her head against a wall. She got back in his good books by writing some kind of letter to Mrs Fenner - we'll have to wait until the next series to find out the letter's content. Monica wanted to commit suicide again and took the drugs - Nikki saved her life but doesnt tell Helen in case it affected Monica's upcoming appeal. Monica won her appeal and, after being released, delivered a speech on TV about the women in prison, which made even the hardest inmates cry! Helen then ran straight from court to the tailors, where Sean was trying on his wedding suit, and</Overview>

  <Overview>As the new series opened, we see Fenner in Helen's office. He obviously thinks that Helen had resigned and that he was the new wing governor. Nikki looked for Helen's car to arrive...it didn't. Zandra went into labour and was rushed to hospital where she gave birth to a baby boy. Helen finally arrived at the prison, resulting in Jim being annoyed that his dreams of promotion were once again shattered. New warden Karen Betts started work - she and Jim have met before it seems. Robin promised to visit Zandra at Larkhall in the future but then took the baby and left when drugs were discovered in Zandra's cell. Zandra then lost it and ran to the prison roof, threatening to jump off! Dominic saved her from a nasty death though by nearly falling off the roof himself! Nikki told Helen that she can't control her feelings for her but Helen still denied she returns the feelings. Shell somehow got a mobile phone smuggled in, dialled a number and said &quot;&quot;Can I speak to Mrs Fenner?&quot;&quot;!</Overview>

Dockley continued her phone calls to Mrs Fenner and then manipulated Jim into searching Nikki Wade's cell! The two Julies told Jim that the washing machine was broken; he said he'd look at it.  Denny wanted to buy a birthday card for her mother, Jessie, who was coming to visit her on her birthday. Yvonne asked the maintenance man Josh to smuggle in some frilly knickers as he came in to fix the washing machine â€“ they were nearly caught by Hollamby who, not believing that Josh was actually fixing the washing machine, stuck her head in it ; getting a soaking for her trouble! Jim searched Nikki's cell for the mobile phone, thinking she has it, and then got attacked by Nikki. This is the last straw,  so Helen gets Nikki shipped out for making malicious phonecalls and for</Overview>

Marilyn and Jim decided to stay together for the children's sake but Jim persuaded Marilyn to send Shell a letter, saying that she had broken up their marriage. Stubberfield told Karen Betts that he wanted her to take over as wing governor after Helen's departure. New Prison Officer, Di Barker, arrived on the wing and seems like a nice quiet girl. Julie J learned that her kids are back in the UK and wanted them to visit. Bodybag took great pleasure by refusing. Jim returned to the wing; he confiscated all the letters that he had sent Shell â€“ now she had no evidence against him. He even told her that he loves her - just so she would lie and tell Stubberfield that she made up the allegations. She did and  Stubberfield believed her. Denny's mother, Jessie, didn't show up for the visit. The Julies polished the stairs more than was necessary â€“ Sylvia fell do</Overview>

Josh tried to get Crystal's attention. Dominic became Shell's new personal officer...Poor him! Denny was depressed because her mother didn't show up last week, but was happier when Di told her that that Jessie couldn't have come even if she wanted to because she had been knocked down and was in hospital. Denny was then allowed to go and visit her, accompanied by Di. Jim threatened to tell Stubberfield about his affair with Karen a few years back, only to be put in his place by Stubbberfield who told that he already knew! Zandra was in constant pain because of the drugs. Denny found her mother had discharged herself and was at her hostel. At the hostel, she discovered Jessie drunk.

  <Overview>New inmate Barbara Hunt arrived on the wing...except it wasn't really barbara. Due to a mix up by Sylvia, it was actually Mad Tessa Spall! The councillor, Meg Richards, arrived to take the group therapy sessions. Zandra had more severe headaches. Shell teased 'Barbara' and got more than she bargained for when she  pinned her against a wall. Nikki received a postcard from Helen. Yvonne gave Sylvia the idea of claiming compensation for her neck injury. After getting Yvonne a private visiting room, Fenner collected his payment later that evening at the golf course from Charlie's golf caddy - unknown to him, he was photographed! 'Barbara' (Mad Tessa) threatened Karen with a syringe of HIV positive blood - they have obviously had a run in at the last prison Karen worked in! Dominic realised the identity mix-up and alerted the other PO's - Jim then saved Karen. Zandra collapsed in pain! The real Barbara Hunt was brought onto the wing.</Overview>

  <Overview>Sylvia was severely repremanded for her mix-up last week and, when she blamed her neck injury for being &quot;&quot;below par&quot;&quot;, was put on an exercise regime. Zandra was diagnosed with low blood pressure and appalling eyesight after her fainting episode - was the Doctor right and did he care? Barbara revealed that she was in prison for helping her terminally ill husband to die and seemed uncomfortable about sharing a room with a lesbian. Shell appeared to be further losing her sanity. Sylvia (and her shellsuit!) were laughed at by everyone. Shell bullied Barbara into getting a pen from art class and then made her write 'Fenner is a rapist' on the wall. Helen visited Nikki, much to Sylvia's shock. Nikki defended Babs when Shell accused her of all the vandalism. Karen discovered that Sylvia's neck wasn't really bad enough to have to wear a neck-collar. Helen became head of the lifers unit.</Overview>

  <Overview>Karen informed the staff of what Helen's new job would entail. Yvonne received a calendar from Charlie, featuring the photographs of Jim, at the golf course, taking the money. Zandra suffered a fit and is taken to the hospital for tests. Yvonne summoned Fenner to her cell to show him the &quot;&quot;4 developments&quot;&quot;;- Photos of him and Charlie with the money. She informs him she wants out of Larkhall, he had no option but to comply. Yvonne wanted the car that she would be in to be held up for her to escape, but that isn't to be - Charlie was really arrested before she left Larkhall - she left anyway and tried to escape from a toilet window on the way to the 'hospital' - Jim latched on to her idea when he reads in a newspaper that Charlie has been arrested, and stopped Yvonne escaping. Helen secretly photocopied Niki's file.</Overview>

  <Overview>Dominic returned from his holiday. Shell told Karen about her childhood - both her parents sexually abused her! She is then worried about her kids, who were staying with her. Karen then set up a visit for her with her mother Rita so that she could discuss the kids. During the meeting, the truth came out and Rita was quick to blame Shell's father. She was told that Shell's children would be taken into care. Yvonne distributed mobile phones to Denny and the 2 Julies - they set up a sex chat line, with Yvonne's daughter Lauren's help. Dominic wass shocked to learn that Zandra had a malignant brain tumour - she needed further tests to determine if it was operable or not. Later, Dr Nicholson unsympathetically told her that it's inoperable and that she had months to live! Dominic voiced his anger that the Dr was doing nothing to help her and that she should be released for her final months. Shell joined the Sex line plan, now called 'Babes Behind Bars', much to Yvonne's annoyance. On Crystal</Overview>

Zandra collapsed again; Later, she asked Crystal to pray for her. Shell found Babs' diary and didn't like the entry about her that called her a â€˜Psychopath'. Dominic kissed Zandra, prompting her to say &quot;&quot;At least one of my dreams came true&quot;&quot;. Shell stole Babs' diary and was quoting parts of it to other people, much to Babs' discomfort. Tissues at the ready because, at that point, Zandra suffered a fatal seizure. The girls held a memorial service for Zandra, during which, Crystal read a note that she had found from Zandra. Dominic arrived half way through with Zandra's baby, Robbie. Crystal had more days added to her sentence after spitting at Dr Nicholson for not helping Zandra enough. Baba entered Shell's cell and demanded her diary back â€“ when Shell refused and started making fun of her late husband, Babs lost her t</Overview>

Karen wanted to know exactly who it was who broke Shell's arm, no-one, including Shell herself, grassed on Babs. Julie J had the idea of inviting the man, John, who she spoke to through 'Babes Behind Bars' to visit her...then she...er...relieved him under the table! He got very annoyed though when Julie dropped the yoghurt pot, in which she was collecting the sperm!!!!! Hardnut, Renee Williams arrived - she obviously knew Yvonne and they seemed like bitter enemies. Denny and Shaz somehow escaped from their cell after lock up and vandalised the toilets. no-one knew that it was them. Shell seemed jealous of the time Denny was now spending with Shaz. The rig was up for 'Babes behind Bars' after a phone was found!

  <Overview>Renee was still causing trouble for the inmates by bullying them. Shaz and Denny lured Sylvia into their cell and then run out and slammed the door, locking her in. She then had to give them her keys to let her out - something that's strictly against the rules! Someone was seen crushing nuts and putting them in the pepper pot. Denny put some mouldy bread into Renee's orange juice. Renee used the spiked pepper and was seen choking and finaly, falling dead to the floor! Helen took the first lifers session. The police interview Shaz about the mouldy bread...she admitted it. After drinking on the job, Fenner left and went home. Renne's tests showed that she had died from an allergy so Shaz was off the hook. Karen demoted Sylvia to a basic officer and docked a months pay as a punishment for the keys incident. Yvonne was seen smirking in her cell - nice one Yvonne! Karen went to see Jim at home and he told her that Marilyn had left him and had taken the kids.</Overview>

  <Overview>Nikki confronted Helen about her night out with Dominic. Karen explained that Sylvia and Jim are off work and also explained about Jim's situation to the other staff. Jim later turned up for work, much to Di and Karen's surprise. Helen had a meeting with Shaz to see how she's coping but Shaz was very flippant about the murders that she had committed â€“ because of this, Helen had the idea of making her meet the family of one of the people she had killed. Dominic assured Di that there was nothing going on between him and Helen. Jim refused to help Di when the inmates started refusing to go into their cells, much to Di's annoyance. Dominic went round to Helen's flat and heard a phone call between her and Nikki â€“ he promised not to say anything. Nikki had heard Dominic's voice at Helen's so it further backed up her theory that Helen was seeing him! Jim apologised to Di for his earlier behaviour.

Sylvia quickly added Karen's name to her guest list. Rules are broken because the 2 Julies and Shell are to be waitresses at the party! They hatched a plan to get alcohol â€“ they hid plastic bags down their â€˜trakkie bottoms'. Crystal was due for release later that day but was delayed due to a transport problem. Nikki offered the nurse £3,000 to help her escape â€“ the nurse accepted and brought a security pass to Nikki's cell later that night and told her that there was a nurse's uniform in a locker.

Sylvia, enraged at the fact that Shell wasn't being punished for her attack on Jim, decideds to take justice into her own hands - after a word with Dr Nicholson, Shell was transferred to the 'muppet wing'. Julie Saunders decided to apply to be a part of a tagging scheme so that she could see her son David's school play. Jim continued to recover well at the hospital.

Later in the week and to Sylvia's disgust, Shell was later allowed back on G-Wing - Sylvia then called on the PO's to go on strike!</Overview>

  <Overview>A fly-on-the-wall TV documentary crew, Kicking Productions, arrived at HMP Larkhall to make a series, creating havoc in the process. Jim Fenner wanted Shell Dockley out of Larkhall for good, and so was willing to go to any lengths to get rid of her...even helping her to escape! Helen told Nikki about Jim's assault on her - meaning that Jim now had yet another enemy on G Wing. Buki's tough girl image disappeared when she was found bleeding in her cell after a violent display of self-harm - and it was all caught on camera by the documentary crew, along with shocking revelations about her childhood. Shell, Denny and Shaz succeeded in their attempt to escape using the keys and money that Jim had left them - unfortunately for Shaz, she sprained her ankle and so had to be left behind...Sylvia realised numbers were down and so began frantically searching...to no avail!</Overview>

  <Overview>The riot finally ended peacefully because Nikki locked the Peckham boot gang in their cells - sadly for her though, Helen told Nikki that their relationship was over because of the part she had played in the chaos. Nikki then took an interest in new prisoner Caroline. The Julies argued over their plans for the future now that Julie S had met Trevor again but to their horror, they were re-arrested outside the prison gates for past crimes they had committed while working for Virginia O'Kane as 'The 2 Trudies'. Helen seemed to be yet more friendly with Dr Waugh. Femi was moved to E-Wing with Fatima, an english-speaking Nigerian prisoner. Nikki was perplexed as to why Helen was telling her to &quot;&quot;be careful&quot;&quot; of Caroline but found out from Maxi that Caroline's crime wasn't fraud...she was in prison for sexually abusing children!!</Overview>

  <Overview>Shaz was bullied again by Al. Di Barker had a sexual encounter in the toilets with Gina Rossi's boyfriend Mark. She lied perfectly to cover her tracks until the end of the episode, when she couldn't hide how hurt she was when Mark said that &quot;&quot;She meant nothing to him&quot;&quot; - A distraught Gina then told Mark she was pregnant! The Julies returned to G-Wing...and so did Virginia O'Kane! Josh continued to ignore Di. Virginia's disability proved a challenge for the officers. To Maxi and Al's disgust, Tina seemed to take a shine to Virginia. Jim, as corrupt as ever, offered to collect Virginia's brothel money for her...for a 50% share of course!...</Overview>

  <Overview>Jim began his 'after-hours job' collecting money from Virginia's brothels. Helen was determined to prove that Jim is unfit to work with female prisoners and was very happy when Yvonne told her about the job he was participating in for Virginia. After yet another arguement between Helen and Jim, Karen made it clear to Helen that she was on Jim's side. Di spread lies about Gina. Virginia, while alone in her cell, stood up to look in the mirror, proving that her disability was a lie. Shaz asked for a transfer to the lifers' unit to get away from Al, but Dr Waugh suggested an unorthodox way of boosting her self-esteem. Crystal received the date for her court appearance. Gina and Di came to blows over Mark, with tragic consequences. Helen and Dr Waugh went to the dog races together and later, at his flat, shared a kiss!</Overview>

  <Overview>Josh received a surprise package from Denny that could prove Crystal's innocence. Jim told Nikki that Helen is now seeing Dr Waugh - Something Helen didn't deny! Virginia's disability was publically outed as a scam by Al. Helen continued to lie in wait for Jim at Virginia's brothels - she finally found him and told him she wanted his resignation letter or she would tell Karen and area. Jim blackmails Di into helping him find evidence about Helen's relationship with Nikki and is overjoyed when he finds in Babs' diary about Nikki's escape. Defeated by this new evidence, Helen has no ammo against Jim and is blackmailed by him to resign. Crystal was found guilty because Karen gave her a bad character statement - this was because Sylvia's stolen clock (remember that?) was found and returned to Karen!</Overview>
