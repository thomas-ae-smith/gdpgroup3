<SeriesName>Discovery Channel - Sensing Murder</SeriesName>
<Overview>Sensing Murder is the television series in the United States, broadcasted on the Discovery Channel, in which alleged psychics are asked to act as psychic detectives to help solve famous unsolved murder cases. The psychics have not managed to solve any of the cases, although they have uncovered facts that only police knew about. They have in some cases provided actual names of persons related to the area the crime was committed to police, names of persons confirmed by serving or ex-serving police officers to have existed and resided in close proximity to locations of crimes around the time they were committed.</Overview>

<SeriesName>Murder in Mind</SeriesName>
<banner>text/7471.jpg</banner>
<Overview>What does it take to drive apparently ordinary human beings to murder? In a BBC season of groundbreaking original movies, Murder in Mind takes viewers on a journey into the psyches of a disparate collection of killers. Exploring the psychology behind the darkest and yet most compelling crime of murder, each of the seven movies explores the ultimate crime through the eyes of the murderer and asks, not whodunit? but whydunit? Cold, calculating and in search of the perfect crime, each killer selects a different method of murder. From euthanasia, contract killing, vigilantes, accidental murder, to the bewildering act of sleepwalking, there is no set formula to the chilling thrillers, only one common theme: death in "suspicious" circumstances. "Murder should be about murderers," insists series creator Anthony Horowitz. "So our first rule was that the killer should take up most screen time. The murderer is the star, not just the plot mechanism." Some murderers appear to escape with</Overview>

<Overview>Welcome to the Virtual Murder guide at TV Tome.  Dr John Cornelius (called JC, and played by the late Nicholas Clay) is a university don who also works for his city police force as a consultant psychologist. The stunning Samantha Valentine (played by Kim Thomson) is his offbeat personal assistant and lover, while Inspector Cadogan is their police contact and Professor Owen Griffiths is Cornelius's head of department.  The show was filmed in and around Birmingham, England and often has the element of fantasy associated with (for instance) The New Avengers - an approach to crime drama which by the early 1990s had gone completely out of fashion. Where else might you see Father Christmas cycling to a police station to empty a sack of bones on the counter? Alas, only one whimsical series was made. Perhaps the show was swimming too much against the tide of gritty realism, but it was competently made with strong casts and is long overdue for a repeat on British television - wak</Overview>

Like most young men his age, Seth struggles, if not to establish a strong social identity, to at least as a cute girl out for a piece of chicken, a task that can be more daunting than a flawless quadruple homicide.  Shit really hits the fan when Seth finally lands a date, and, go figure -- duty calls.  Can Seth keep his two lives in line and save his world from imploding? Will he get away with murder?</Overview>

<SeriesName>In Denial of Murder</SeriesName>
<Overview>A drama that time-shifts between the 1970's and the present to tell the story of Stephen Downing, who was wrongly jailed in 1973 for the murder of Wendy Sewell. More than 20 years on local newspaper editor Don Hale takes up the case. This dramitised account picks up in 1994 when Downing's parents first approached Hale. They claimed their son was the victim of a miscarriage of justice after he made a false confession under police duress. The Downing case is a compelling story and, as presented here, it's easy to see how Hale got caught up in it. Apart from the fact that it's a dream for a small town paper, there's the suggestion of a small town closing ranks and the apparently checkered romantic history of the victim.</Overview>

To earn a reputation like that, you had to have your contacts on the inside. Sometimes, even cross the line. That's when the distinction between cop and criminal can blur.

NEDDY SMITH, one of Australia's most notorious criminals found himself keeping company with the elite members of the police force. Overnight, a two-bit crim with a cruel streak became the kingpin of a crime and drugs syndicate. He had the green light. He was untouchable.

MICHAEL DRURY was an honest cop in the wrong place at the wrong time. His crime was to turn down a bribe. The man who offered it to him was Roger Rogerson. To say Drury was surprised would be an understatement. But he thought it would end there... He was dead wrong.</Overview>

<Overview>The lease on the Dupayne Museum is almost up and under the terms of their father's will, all three of the Dupayne children must agree to continue or the museum is to close. Neville Dupayne is dead set against continuing the museum when the money could be used for a much better purpose. One of the museum's key attractions is the Murder Room, displaying information on a series of notorious murders from between the two World Wars. When Neville dies in a way reminiscent of one of the murders on display in the Murder Room, Commander Adam Dalgleish is asked to investigate. There are any number of suspects: his siblings, several museum employees who will lose their job, his secretary with whom he once had an affair and his daughter who felt he was an absentee father. A second murder reveals some of the activities of the upper classes and the solution lies in a long-ago wrong that someone is seeking to right. Written by garykmcd

London's Dupayne Museum is in danger of closing since one of the trustees feels that the money expended on preserving the past could be better spent addressing the problems of living people. One of the museum's collections concerns murders committed between the world wars. When a killing that reflects one of the cases on display occurs, history seems to be repeating itself. Adam Dalgleish is assigned the case, due to the involvement of someone in a "sensitive" government position. Adam juggles a romance with sleuthing as the deaths continue.</Overview>
